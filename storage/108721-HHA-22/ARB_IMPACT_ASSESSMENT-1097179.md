Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.0 Introduction

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.1 Mulberry Tree Management were instructed by M Mulholland, to carry out an arboricultural survey of trees at her property in Groby Place, Altrincham.

Text: 1.0 Introduction This report details the arboricultural implications of developing the site, including:

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.2

Text: 1.0 Introduction • a survey of the trees on and near the development which may impact the proposal from ground level, noting their location, species and all relevant parameters, i.e. stem diameter, height, crown spread, condition etc;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • providing advice on the removal, retention and management of trees;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • assessment of the potential effects of the proposal on retained trees and vice versa;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • assessment of the requirement for tree protection for the duration of the works;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • mitigation for any loss;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • preparation of a tree schedule;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • and report on the above matters.

Text: 1.0 Introduction The survey was carried out on 15 July 2022 by means of inspection from ground level by an experienced and qualified arboriculturalist. The inspection can be restricted in cases where trees were Ivy clad or surrounded by vegetation.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.3

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.4 Under BS5837: 2012 Trees in Relation to Construction - Recommendations, the assessment of trees is made objectively. The tree categorisation method identifies the quality and value of the existing tree stock, allowing informed decisions to be made concerning development design layout.

Text: 1.0 Introduction The following documents have been made available by the client:

Text: 1.0 Introduction • Drawing- 22 239 PL100 plans and elevs as proposed arb issue 28.06.2022.dwg

Text: 1.0 Introduction The supplied drawing included some tree positions plotted. Any dimensions regarding tree positions and protective fencing must be checked on site.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.6

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.7 Weather conditions during the survey were dry and still.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.8 The survey was carried out noting the conditions of the trees at the time of inspection. As trees are part of the natural environment, conditions can naturally change; therefore the contents of this report are valid for one year only. After this period, re-inspection may be necessary.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.0 Survey Methodology

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.1 The trees were surveyed (prefixed T, or G for group) and recorded in the tree schedule in appendix one. Where groups are recorded, average height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trees in the group are reported. Where access to the base of any trees was limited, stem size was estimated.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.2 All the trees were assessed using: a grading A to C (retention) and U (removal); condition and age class as defined in appendix two.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.3 Where appropriate, canopy spread for each tree was recorded at four cardinal points in order to reproduce an accurate representation of the crown shape of the tree on the tree plan in appendix three.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.4 The survey included all trees within the proposal area and trees near to the proposal.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.0 Development Proposals

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.1 Due to the proposed development and its associated infrastructure there are a number of locations where the proposals are in close proximity to the trees surveyed. The Site Layout Plan within appendix three identifies the trees in relation to the proposed development.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.2 In order to fully assess the impact of the proposals an Impact Table has been created detailing each tree, which shows the proximity of the associated works to the tree.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.3 This can then be assessed in accordance with BS 5837:2012 to determine whether the development will have a detrimental impact on the health of each tree. Once this has been determined remedial measures can be detailed to reduce the impact the proposals will have on the treescape.

Text: 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations

Text: 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations 5.1 The tree categorisation method identifies the quality and value of the existing tree stock but it is not meant to be interpreted rigidly and is presented in order to form a balanced judgement on tree retention and removal.

Text: 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations 5.2 A precautionary method of working near trees is detailed in the accompanying Arboricultural Method Statement.

Text: 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations 5.3 Following site development, regular (annual or biannual) inspections of all retained trees should be undertaken by a qualified Arboricultural Consultant.

Text: 5.0 Conclusions and Arboricultural Recommendations 5.4 It is considered that in following the advice in this document, any negative factors affecting trees on the site will be minimised.
