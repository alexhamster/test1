Text: A safe investment in the future State-of-the-art heating technology with minimal environmental impact

Text: A safe investment in the future Vaillant is continuously advancing the development of heat pump technology. The Vaillant research and development teams constantly strive to develop the most efficient and quiet heat pumps on the market, thoroughly testing them in our own testing centres for durability and performance. For example, we have climate and hail chambers where we can test for robustness and reliability in extreme conditions. Vaillant also manufactures only in Europe, so we can guarantee you and your customers receive the high quality expected from a Vaillant appliance.

Text: A safe investment in the future Vaillant offers a great new model in our portfolio of air-to-water heat pumps with the introduction of the aroTHERM plus. This award-winning heat pump is the first in our range to use natural refrigerant R290. This refrigerant, commonly used in many household appliances, has a very low Global Warming Potential (GWP) that offers many advantages over refrigerants traditionally used in heat pumps.

Text: A safe investment in the future The new aroTHERM plus heat pump has technical features for improved efficiency, as well as higher flow temperatures, so it's perfect for new and existing heating systems (including hybrid). It's also impressively quiet in operation and has been accredited by Quiet Mark*.

Text: A safe investment in the future *Models 3.5, 5, 7 and 12kW

Text: Always the right choice Always the right choice

Text: Always the right choice Reliability and performance of the highest standards ensure peace of mind for your customers. It's so quiet, they won't even know it's on.

Text: Always the right choice Higher energy-efficiency

Text: Always the right choice With a SCOP of up to 5.03, the aroTHERM plus is extremely energy efficient, enabling high energy savings against certain fossil fuels. The aroTHERM plus can also be combined with photovoltaic systems and integrated into smart power grids (SG-ready), so your customers can enjoy the benefits of variable electricity tariffs.

Text: Always the right choice The aroTHERM plus heat pump has been designed to deliver the very best performance with low running costs, making it suitable for radiators as well as underfloor heating. With a flow temperature of up to 75°C, the aroTHERM plus can deliver more usable hot water with high hot water comfort levels and removes the need for direct electric immersion to sterilise the water, protecting from legionella.

Text: Natural refrigerant Already fulfilling the next NZEB requirements, the aroTHERM plus uses monobloc technology with a hermetically sealed refrigerant circuit using the natural refrigerant, R290, to deliver the one of the lowest GWP of 3.

Text: Natural refrigerant With sound power as low as 54 dB for easier planning and siting, the aroTHERM plus is suitable for use in densely built-up terraced housing estates.

Text: Why R290? Why R290?

Text: Why R290? R290 is a natural refrigerant with a very low GWP* of three. This offers the following advantages:

Text: Why R290? Model calculation R290 (aroTHERM plus) 0.6 kg R290 x 3 GWP = 1.8 kg CO2

Text: Why R290? • future-proof, as not affected by the F-Gas Regulation

Text: Why R290? • higher flow temperature of up to 75oC

Text: Why R290? • higher hot water comfort and protection against legionella without electric auxiliary heating

Text: Why R290? 15 km journey by car

Text: Why R290? • wider performance envelope with operating temperature ranging between -25°C and +46°C
