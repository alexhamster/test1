Text: Comment Details Comment:The two questions in the Planning Application under "Trees and Hedges" relating to "falling distance" and "removed or pruned" have both been answered as "no" which is patently erroneous. The Silver Birch tree which is approximately 50- 60 feet tall and approximately 15 - 20 feet in girth is a potential hazard should it become unstable. If the construction work impacts on the root plate and cuts through stabilising roots this will lead to a higher risk of wind rock and wind blow with the tree falling in an unpredictable direction should the weather conditions create such an environment. The tree sits in a "wind tunnel" and is prone to wind rock already. The trunk of the tree has already had to be accommodated when the boundary fence was replaced and future growth if not restrained will cause damage. The annual leaf drop is detrimental to neighbouring planting systems. The existing tree reduces the available light reaching ground level which is also detrimental to plant growth. In addition it could also allow pathogens to establish and cause root decay leading to tree failure and hence instability. We refer the planners and the Applicant to https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2021/root-protection-areas/ and https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/publications/2019/01/residential-developments-and-trees regarding the material consideration for the tree on this site. Additionally, we object to the two storey affecting our privicy.
