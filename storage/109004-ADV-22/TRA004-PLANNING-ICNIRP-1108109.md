Text: ICNIRP Exclusion Zone ICNIRP Exclusion Zone

Text: ICNIRP Exclusion Zone This information pack contains important Health and Safety information relevant to a radio cell station instance. Property Managers should make this pack available to their employees, external contractors and personnel who in the course of their work may come in close proximity to the base station antennas.

Text: Contact Number Contact Number

Text: Contact Number For all queries regarding the sites, a telephone line is given for interested parties to call.

Text: Contact Number Also before any work is conducted and to ensure safe working within the specified antenna exclusion zone, the free phone number should be called in order to turn off the cell.

Text: Contact Number The cell number, site name and location should be provided as shown on the signage at the site.

Text: Contact Number Emissions Compliance

Text: Contact Number BT build of the base stations locations, configuration and position of the antennas is done in such a manner that compliance limit distances (aka exclusion zones) cannot be breached without either illegally climbing onto structure or passing physical barriers.

Text: Contact Number The site will be designed to be compliant with the requirements of the radio frequency (RF) public and occupational exposure guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), as expressed in EU Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 “on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0Hz to 300GHz)”1.

Text: Contact Number The compliance takes into account the proposed radio frequency emissions of the equipment and any other operator equipment on this site.

Text: Contact Number ICNIRP Exposure Limitations

Text: Contact Number ICNIRP2 is the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. ICNIRP is recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Labour Organisation as the international independent advisory body for non-ionising radiation protection.

Text: Contact Number The functions of the Commission are to investigate the hazards of non-Ionising Radiation (NIR), to develop international guidelines on NIR exposure limits and to deal with all aspects of NIR protection.

Text: Contact Number The guidelines were derived as a result of laboratory and epidemiological studies into the biological effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). The ICNIRP public exposure guideline is in accordance with the precautionary approach outlined by the Stewart Report (IEGMP)3.

Text: Contact Number Basic restrictions for power density for frequencies between 10 and 300 GHz

Text: Contact Number Power density (W/m2) Exposure 2-300 GHz 0.4-2 GHz Occupational 50 f/40 General public 10 f/200

Text: Contact Number 1. where f is in MHz

Text: Contact Number Power densities are to be averaged over any 20 cm2 of exposed area.
