Text: SITE CONTEXT & HEITAGE APPRAISAL The Hale Station Conservation Area consists of a wealth of architectural styles and building uses, and as such is split into 5 ‘Character Zones’; the applicant site, no. 92 Ashley Road, is a residential dwelling located on the western side of the conservation area and falls into Character Zone D – ‘Suburban Villas – West’.

Text: SITE CONTEXT & HEITAGE APPRAISAL Character Zone D is typically defined by dwellings constructed in the Arts & Crafts style, consisting of red brick walls with intricate timber and masonry detailing. No. 92 Ashley Road, and the neighbouring properties within the terrace, are mid-late 19th century properties with simpler detailing than most within Character Zone D, however remain traditional in appearance and are congruous with the rest of the conservation area. ‘Map 3’ of the Hale Station Management Plan indicates that the applicant property is a ‘positive contributor’ to the conservation area (along with most buildings within the area) and fronts a key vista along Ashley Road, however the property is not denoted as Article 4. The view of no. 92 Ashley Road along the ‘vista’ is shown below:

Text: PROPOSED DESIGN PROPOSED DESIGN

Text: Scale Scale

Text: Scale The proposals consist of the removal of the existing conservatory the rear of the property, to be replaced with a ground floor side/rear infill extension between the existing outrigger extensions of the applicant property, no. 92 Ashley Road, and the neighbouring property, no. 90 Ashley Road. The addition is modest in terms of scale, occupying a total area of just 6.1m2. The proposed extension is to finish flush with the rear walls of the existing outriggers and project no further. The proposed ground floor plan can be seen below with the minimal extent of the extension works indicated in yellow:

Text: Design Design

Text: Design The internal works to the property seek to improve cohesion between the different areas of the dwelling. As existing, the lower ground floor occupies the long, dark, narrow kitchen with the dining and living spaces then found at ground floor. The proposals look to relocate the kitchen to the ground floor and open up the rear of the ground floor to create an environment better suited to modern open plan living. New contemporary sliding doors to the rear of the property aim to maximise natural light within the deep plan of the ground floor, while also helping to tie the proposed extension into the existing outrigger.

Text: Design All works to the property are proposed to the rear, ensuring that the front of the dwelling remains unaffected by the works. According to the Hale Station Management Plan, the vista is seen along the front of the elevation down Ashley Road, so by ensuring all works are proposed to the rear of the dwelling we are ensuring that this vista is not affected. Similarly all existing original features, boundary treatments and green spaces to the front of the property remain untouched.

Text: Materiality Materiality

Text: Materiality The proposed material palette of the extension is to match that of the existing dwelling, where possible reusing bricks from the removal of the existing side facing wall of the outrigger to ensure an accurate brick match. Brick soldier course detailing above the new sliding doors to the rear provides cohesion with the detailing of the neighbouring outrigger, as well as with that found on the front elevation of the property.

Text: CONCLUSION CONCLUSION

Text: CONCLUSION The applicant property is described as a positive contributor to the Hale Station Conservation Area due to the architectural style of the building in relation to those adjacent along Ashley Road, therefore consideration has been made on the potential impact the proposals may have on neighbouring properties and the wider context of the conservation area – inclusive of material choices, massing and appearance. All alterations to the dwelling are proposed to the rear in order to avoid any disruption to the visual characteristic of the vista along Ashley Road, with the front elevation remaining unchanged.

Text: CONCLUSION Point 2.1.3 of the Hale Station Management Plan emphasises one of the issues within the conservation area relates to the pressure to adapt dwellings to 21st century living. Through carefully considered design choices both internally and externally we believe we have achieved this, providing maximum impact to the usability of the dwelling with minimal impact externally. We believe that the changes to the property are justified within this context, and help to improve the positive contribution made to the conservation area by the applicant property.
