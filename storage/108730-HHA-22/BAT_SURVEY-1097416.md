Text: Summary Summary

Text: Summary This report has been prepared by Tyler Grange Group Limited on behalf of Mr and Mrs Campbell. It sets out the findings of a Preliminary Roost Assessment and subsequent nocturnal bat surveys of a property at ‘Park End’, Dunham Massey (centred at OS Grid Reference SJ7403487544), hereinafter referred to as the 'site'. The site is subject to a planning application for the alteration of the north western flat roof section of the building from flat to pitched roof.

Text: Summary S.1.

Text: Summary S.2. The purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of the ecological importance of the site for bats, the potential impact of the proposed development and the required mitigation and suggested enhancements to form a net gain of ecological value.

Text: Summary S.3. Following the Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA), the building was assessed as having moderate bat roost potential, and was subject to an initial two nocturnal surveys, comprising a separate dusk and dawn survey in line with best-practice survey guidelines.

Text: Summary S.4. During these surveys, a small number (2) of soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded roosting within the property. In order to formally characterise the roost in accordance with best-practice guidelines, a third survey was completed. . The two roost locations have been characterized as opportunistic summer day roosts of individual bats.

Text: Summary S.5. Due to the presence of a confirmed roost within the property, it will be necessary for a licence to be obtained from Natural England to allow the proposed works to proceed lawfully. Based on the current characterisation of the roost, it falls within the criteria eligible for a ‘low impact’ or Mitigation Class Licence. The broad mitigation required by this licence is set out in this report, which outlines how the works will be carried out under licence and supervision by a licensed consultant, along with mitigation recommendations to support roosting bats post-development.

Text: Summary S.6. By following the mitigation and enhancement measures outlined within this report the proposed enhancements at the site will also lead to a net gain in roosting opportunities for bat species at the site.

Text: Scope of Works Scope of Works

Text: Scope of Works The surveys followed standard methodologies set out in the Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell, Jones, 2004), the Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004) and Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists - Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016) and comprised:

Text: Scope of Works 2.1

Text: Scope of Works • Desk Study – reviewing online records of bat roosts or presence within the local area gathered from MAGIC;

Text: Scope of Works • Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA) – ground-level external building inspection survey to assess potential of the building on site to support roosting bats; and

Text: Scope of Works • Detailed Roost Surveys – dusk emergence and dawn re-entry surveys conducted on the building to assess the presence or likely absence of roosting bats.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA)

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) An external inspection of the buildings was undertaken on 11th April 2022 by Dale Mortiboys BSc ACIEEM (Natural England Bat Survey Class Licence CL18).

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.2

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) The weather conditions for the survey were 14°C, dry, light breeze (Beaufort scale 2) and 50% cloud cover.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.3

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) A detailed external inspection of the building at the site was undertaken to determine the presence of live or dead bats, signs of bat use and features that may support bat roosting directly or allow access to features further within the structure of the building.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.4

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) This survey followed standard methodologies outlined within Bat Survey for Professional Ecologists Good Practice Guidelines (Collins 2016), Bat Workers’ Manual (3rd Edition) (Mitchell- Jones, A.J. and McLeish, A.P., 2004) and Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell-Jones, A.J., 2004).

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.5

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.6 The potential of the building to support roosting bats was categorised against the criteria described in Table 2.1.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Table 2.1: Roost Assessment Criteria (adapted from Collins, 2016)

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Suitability Roosting Habitats Negligible Negligible habitat features on-site likely to be used by roosting bats. A structure with one or more potential roost sites that could be used by individual bats opportunistically. However, these potential roost sites do not provide enough space, shelter, protection, appropriate conditions and/or suitable surrounding habitat to be Low used on a regular basis or by larger numbers of bats (i.e. unlikely to be suitable for maternity or hibernation). A tree of sufficient size and age to contain PRFs but with none seen from the ground or features seen with only very limited roosting potential. A structure or tree with one or more potential roost sites that could be used by bats due Moderate to their size, shelter, protection, conditions and surrounding habitat but unlikely to support a roost of high conservation status roost type. A structure or tree with one or more potential roost sites that are obviously suitable for High use by larger numbers of bats on a more regular basis and potentially for long periods of time due to their size, shelter, protection conditions and surrounding habitat.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Limitations

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) The building roof void was not inspected internally due to the sparsity of available hatch space in relation to the rotundness of the surveyor. This is not thought to affected the outcomes of this report.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.7

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys Nocturnal Bat Surveys

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys The building PRA identified potential roost features (PRF’s) to be present and assessed the building as providing ‘moderate’ potential to support roosting bats. In accordance with BCT guidelines, this triggers a requirement for at least two nocturnal roost surveys to establish the presence or likely absence of roosting bats.

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.8

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.9 In line with this guidance, one dusk emergence survey and one dawn re-entry survey were undertaken within the months of May-July 2022, the details of which are available in Table 2.2 below. Survey effort was informed by best practice guidelines (Collins, 2016). During the dawn survey on the 16th June a soprano pipistrelle bat was observed entering the western gable end. This prompted an additional third nocturnal survey to be completed for roost characterisation

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys Four surveyors were positioned around the building to provide adequate coverage of all suitable features – see Plan 15107/RL01b for surveyor locations. Surveyors used a combination of visual observation and echolocation detection to identify and bats emerging from the building, assisted by two-way radios in order to correlate bat movements between surveyors. Survey equipment used comprised Bat loggers, anabat scouts, anabat expresses with Batbox Duets, an echometer touch Pro and an anabat walkabout. The detectors recorded in frequency division and full spectrum formats. Elekon’s Bat Explorer software was used to analyse sonograms of any calls recorded in the field.

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.10

Text: Survey Limitations Survey Limitations

Text: Survey Limitations 2.11 The property was not inspected internally. Due to the design of the roof, there were some blind spots to the surveyor caused by roof valleys. These limitations are not considered to have affected the conclusions on determining the level of bat roosting potential.

Text: Survey Limitations 2.12 Bats use a variety of roosts, ranging from maternity, mating or swarming and hibernation roosts, containing many individuals, to mating or night-time feeding roosts containing few individuals or single animals. Bats also tend to be nomadic (although are faithful to certain favoured roosting sites), spending variable lengths of time in a variety of roosts. As a result, even with the considerable survey effort it is possible that small transient roosts of bats may have been missed, although these tend to be less important to bats and so this should not affect the evaluation and recommendations made.

Text: Survey Limitations 2.13 The weather was optimal during the nocturnal surveys and sufficient confidence is therefore placed in the results obtained.

Text: Desk Study Desk Study

Text: Desk Study The desk study for bat records on the wider area revealed no recent bat licence applications within 1km of the site.

Text: Desk Study 3.1.

Text: Desk Study The habitats onsite include a large tree lined garden that borders a woodland close to the Dunham Massey country estate and therefore represents a suitable foraging resource. The garden is not likely to be key for commuting bats. The woodland adjacent to the site is likely to represent a significant foraging resource to bats as well as offering roosting and commuting opportunities.

Text: Desk Study 3.2.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment Preliminary Roost Assessment

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment External

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The building is a late 19th century semi-detached brick build adjacent to the Dunham Massey Park estate. The pitched roof is slate and is generally in a good state of repair. The main ridge runs east to west with shorter dormer pitches to the north and south. The property adjoins the neighbouring house on the western aspect.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.3.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.4. The northern aspect gable end is in good condition with no visible point of potential access in the soffits. A small, sloped porch roof has several slipped and crack tiles offering opportunistic roosting for crevice dwelling species.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The western aspect gable end, eaves and soffits are well sealed, and the two storey flat roof extension shows no sign of bat potential roosting features (PRF). However, the ends of the roof pitch on the western aspect, as well as the southern aspect, show signs of wear at approximately the last two tiles. Due to the positioning, this would create direct access to the roof space, but could offer crevice roosting potential as well.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.5.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.6. The southern area of the roof is more complex with a single storey flat roof extension as well as large dormer pitched roof. The slates and lead flashing around this dormer area, as well as the wider southern roof have several areas of PRFs. These include lifted lead flashing around the chimney and roof valleys, slipped and damaged roof slates and gaps at the ridge tiles. There is also a dual pitched slate roofed outhouse closely situated to the southern extension. This has slipped slates and raised lead flashing. The soffits and eaves of the roof are largely in good condition.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.7. Overall, the property is considered to be of moderate potential for bat roosting.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The building was of negligible potential for hibernating bats due to lack of open basement or other area of stable thermal mass. Limited number of features occur on the external surfaces of the structure, but these are shallow (e.g. less than 10cm deep). All such features would not, individually, be able to hold more than one or two bats and would not typically be regarded as providing the protection from weather or provide the favourable temperature and humidity conditions required during the winter period

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys Dusk Emergence Survey (23/05/2022)

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.8. No emergence recorded.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys One soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus was recorded emerging from an adjacent building offsite; however, the precise emergence location was unable to be determined (21:49).

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.9.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.10. Myotis spp., common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, noctule Nyctalus noctula and brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus were recorded throughout the survey. Many recordings relate to relate to foraging behaviour along the tree boundary to the south, and over the garden to the east and south of the site. Other recordings relate to commuting behaviour to the northeast of the house and along the tree line to the south.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys Dawn Re-entry Survey (16/06/2022)

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.11. Two Soprano Pipistrelle re-entries were recorded on the gable end of southwest facing dormer (Plan: 15107_ECG_300622). The first re-entry was on the end of the roof pitch of southwest facing dormer (RE1 - 04:17). The second re-entry was under end tiles of the southwest facing dormer, on the southern corner (RE2 - 04:26).

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.12. Myotis spp., common Pipistrelle, and soprano Pipistrelle were also recorded throughout the survey, utilizing the woodland adjacent to the site to the south as a foraging route.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys Dusk Emergence Survey (11/07/2022)

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.13. No emergence recorded.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.14. Common and soprano pipistrelle noctule and brown long-eared bat were recorded throughout the survey. Many recordings relate to relate to foraging behaviour along the tree boundary to the south, and over the garden to the east and south of the site. Other recordings relate to commuting behaviour to the northeast of the house and along the tree line to the south.

Text: Roost Summary Roost Summary

Text: Roost Summary 3.15. Two locations on the dormer window on the southern (rear) elevation were recorded as having summer day roosts for individual bats. This dormer window is part of the main roof and not part of the roof considered during this planning application. Both flat roof areas of the site were found to have No Roosts Present following the three nocturnal surveys.

Text: Section 4: Implications, Mitigation/Enhancement Strategy and Conclusions Section 4: Implications, Mitigation/Enhancement Strategy and Conclusions

Text: Site Proposals Site Proposals

Text: Site Proposals 4.1. The proposed development will include the repitching of the two storey flat roof section of the property that is in the west of site. This newly created pitched roof will tie in with the main building wall below the existing main pitched roof. As such it will not impact the main roof.

Text: Site Proposals 4.2. The single storey flat roof section on the south of the building will be demolished and a new extension built with a single pitched roof tying in to the main building below the first floor windows.

Text: Site Proposals 4.3. There is a need to reroof the main roof due to poor state of repair. This work does not require planning and is not dealt with directly within this report, however, recommendations relating to works around the main roof/bats roosts are covered to ensure best guidance is available.

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment 4.4. The repitching of the two storey flat roof as covered by the proposed plan ( Plan 2:0014-StA-XX- 00-DR-A-203) would not directly affect a bat roost. In the absence of any mitigation measures, demolition of the existing flat roof would result in no impact to known bat roosts as the flat roof section is separate to the main pitched roof.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.5. The demolition of the single storey flat roof section would not directly impact any known bat roost.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.6. In the absence of any mitigation measures, the alterations to the two flat roof areas on the building would result in no loss of protected bat roosts or shelters. The works would cause no other ecological impacts.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.7. The building on site was noted to contain two individual soprano pipistrelle day roosts. These are located away from the flat roof section considered as the proposals in the report. However, the main roof of the house may require reroofing, so implications are discussed here.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.8. In the absence of any mitigation measures, reroofing of the existing main roof would result in the destruction of a shelter place used by a European Protected Species. Resultantly, a licence from Natural England would be required to allow the demolition of the roof to proceed lawfully. The following section details the mitigation measures required for the lawful demolition of the existing roof under licence. The roost status was determined to fall under the category for the Bat Low Impact Class Licence.

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Mitigation and Enhancement

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement 4.9. Under the Bat Mitigation Guidelines, roosts of the lowest conservation status (i.e., small numbers of common/widespread species) do not require any specific mitigation or replacement roost features.

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Park End, Dunham Massey Bat Survey Report

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Page 9

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Demolition/Construction Phase

Text: Repitching of two storey flat roof area Repitching of two storey flat roof area

Text: Repitching of two storey flat roof area 4.10. The removal of the flat roof section is not required to be supervised by a bat ecologist due to the absence of any bat roost and therefore constraint to this section of the building. If a bat is discovered during the works, works in that locale should stop and ecological advise is to be sought.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Proposed reroof of main roof

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.11. A suitably licensed/qualified bat ecologist will supervise the roofing activity. The area containing the roost will be inspected (with a Mobile Elevated Working Platform [MEWP] utilised where necessary) by the ecologist, assisted with an endoscope if necessary. All areas where roosting bats could be present will be carefully and slowly dismantled. Any roosting bats encountered will either be caught by hand and relocated to one of the boxes on a nearby retained tree or allowed to fly away of their own accord. Once the ecologist is satisfied that all potential roost locations have been destroyed, the demolition works can commence in earnest with no other prescriptions.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.12. Due to the small number of bats seen emerging and the low conservation status of day roosts for soprano pipistrelles there are no seasonal constraints for the works.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.13. There is no recommendation for further mitigation regarding the conversion of the flat roof to pitched and tying in with the existing roof. If the project is delayed beyond 12 months of the date of the surveys, update surveys may be required. In this instance further advice should be sought by a Suitably Qualified Ecologist (SQE).

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Enhancement of the site

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.14. As bats are listed as a European Protected Species (EPS), replacement bat boxes are proposed on nearby trees and/or on the building itself. Boxes should be placed within the mature trees at the south edge of the site. TwoSchwegler 1FF bat boxes (or equivalent) and will be installed prior to the demolition work commencing. Examples of the bat boxes can be seen in Appendix 1.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.15. If considered suitable to the aesthetics of the proposed works built in bat tiles could also be considered. This can be confirmed prior to the Natural England Licence application.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Lighting

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.16. Due to the high amounts of foraging activity reported within the site boundary, the lighting scheme for the development must ensure that adjacent habitats which could be used by bats (i.e., woodland to the south) is not lit so bats can continue to forage/commute on-site and around the site’s boundaries. Artificial light spill along green spaces of the site should be avoided, along with the lighting of any of the enhancement bat boxes. This will retain bat foraging and commuting at the site and ensure that roosting provisions are more likely to be utilized. Lighting can be sensor triggered to ensure the garden is both safe to use by residents and suitably dark for retained use by bats.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: Conclusions Conclusions

Text: Conclusions 4.17. The proposed development actions that are the key consideration of this report i.e the demolition of the single storey flat roof and the repitching of the two storey flat roof section will result in no direct impact to known bat roosts.

Text: Conclusions 4.18. The required additional reroofing of the main roof (not subject to planning approval) will result in the destruction of a shelter place used by a European Protected Species and will require a licence from Natural England to proceed lawfully. However, due to the low conservation status of the roost, it is anticipated that with the implementation of the mitigation and enhancement measures described above, ecological impacts would be adequately mitigated.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 “Protecting and enhancing valued landscapes, sites of biodiversity or geological value and soils (in a manner commensurate with their statutory status or identified quality in the development plan);recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside, and the wider benefits from natural capital and ecosystem services – including the economic and other benefits of the best and most versatile agricultural land, and of trees and woodland; and minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity, including by establishing coherent ecological networks that are more resilient to current and future pressures”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.6 Paragraph 171 states that plans should distinguish between the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated sites; allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value; take a strategic approach to maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green infrastructure; and plan for the enhancement of natural capital at a catchment or landscape scale across local authority boundaries.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.7 Paragraph 174 states that in order to protect and enhance biodiversity and geodiversity, plans should:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 a) “Identify, map and safeguard components of local wildlife-rich habitats and wider ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international, national and locally desig- nated sites of importance for biodiversity; wildlife corridors and stepping stones that connect them; and areas identified by national and local partnerships for habitat man- agement, enhancement, restoration or creation; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) promote the conservation, restoration and enhancement of priority habitats, ecological networks and the protection and recovery of priority species; and identify and pursue opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.8 When determining planning applications, Paragraph 175 states that local planning authori- ties should aim to conserve and enhance biodiversity by applying the following principles:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 a) “if significant harm to biodiversity resulting from a development cannot be avoided (through locating on an alternative site with less harmful impacts), adequately miti- gated, or, as a last resort, compensated for, then planning permission should be refused;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) development on land within or outside a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and which is likely to have an adverse effect on it (either individually or in combination with other developments), should not normally be permitted. The only exception is where the bene- fits of the development in the location proposed clearly outweigh both its likely impact on the features of the site that make it of special scientific interest, and any broader impacts on the national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 c) development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees) should be refused, unless there are wholly excep- tional reasons58 and a suitable compensation strategy exists; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 d) development whose primary objective is to conserve or enhance biodiversity should be supported; while opportunities to incorporate biodiversity improvements in and around developments should be encouraged, especially where this can secure measurable net gains for biodiversity.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.9 As stated in paragraph 176 the following should be given the same protection as habitats sites:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 “potential Special Protection Areas and possible Special Areas of Conservation;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) listed or proposed Ramsar sites; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 c) sites identified, or required, as compensatory measures for adverse effects on habitats sites, potential Special Protection Areas, possible Special Areas of Conservation, and listed or proposed Ramsar sites.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.10 Paragraph 177 states that the presumption in favour of sustainable development does not apply where development requiring appropriate assessment because of its potential impact on a habitats site is being planned or determined.
