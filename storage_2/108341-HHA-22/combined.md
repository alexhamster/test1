Text: Introduction: Introduction:

Text: Introduction: This statement should be read in conjunction with the application form and supporting drawings.

Text: Introduction: drawings.

Text: Introduction: This statement will weigh up the significance of the development and impact that it may have on the building.

Text: Introduction: For reasons identified in this statement it is considered that the application proposal represents appropriate development and has no significant or detrimental impact upon the significance, setting or character of the heritage asset.

Text: Site: Site:

Text: Site: The property is grade Il listed, dating back to late 18th century. Two story building with flemish bond brick and slate roof. Formerly single depth but made double by a rear extension in 20th century. All have casement windows with glazing bars.

Text: Appearance: Appearance:

Text: Appearance: The proposed changes will be visible from the rear side of the building. Proposed windows will be identical size.

Text: Appearance: Replacing 5 white timber casement windows with softwood timber casement windows in arctic white finish. The proposed products are of a much higher quality than the existing and far more aesthetically pleasing than the current design. The new windows are more energy efficient than the older design and will significantly decrease energy loss and subsequently reduce energy bills. In terms of environmental conservation, the proposed new windows will only have a positive impact on the environment as the reduction in energy bills will only serve for a more environmentally friendly installation.

Text: Scale: Scale:

Text: Scale: As for scale, in terms of additional space, there will be no change to the footprint of the property in any way.

Text: Layout: Layout:

Text: Layout: There will be no changes to the layout of the property. This will of course not affect conservation in any way

Text: Landscaping: Landscaping:

Text: Landscaping: There will be no changes to the landscaping of the property. This will of course not affect conservation in any way.

Text: Justification Statement: Justification Statement:

Text: Justification Statement: It can be suggested that the new windows will have more of a positive impact on the property than the existing.

Text: Justification Statement: Modern times call for more careful consideration of our environment and how we look after it. One main problem that is common in all aspects of life is energy loss. It’s expensive, unnecessary, wasteful and damages the environment. By improving building techniques, using higher energy rated products and creating higher quality installations, we can reduce this loss.

Text: Justification Statement: The new proposal contains products which fall in a much higher band of energy conservation than what was previously achievable. This will obviously only have positive effects, not only for the environment but also for financial savings on behalf of property owner.

Text: Justification Statement: owner.

Text: Justification Statement: To conclude, | feel that the new proposal will only serve to enhance the property both visually and economically, blending naturally with the surroundings.
