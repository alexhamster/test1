Text: Proposals Proposals

Text: Proposals The property is detached and sits between / adjacent to other detached and semi-detached Victorian style houses,

Text: Proposals located within the Bowdon Conservation Area. See diagram 1 Conservation area map below.

Text: Proposals Diagram 1. Bowdon Conservation Area

Text: Proposals Bowdon Conservation area is made up of architectural quality and built form in areas identified by Character zones our property falls under Character Zone C: The early Victorian expansion.

Text: Proposals Although there is a range of plot and house sizes and materials, the predominant impression is of large houses, built in various colours; buff, red, brown bricks and white renders generally set within gardens with mature trees and shrubs.

Text: Proposals The property, dating from the late 18th Century (circa. 1838 – 1877), shares many of the characteristics of the area.

Text: Proposals See diagram 3 Building dates below.

Text: Proposals 3

Text: Proposals Paragraphs 189-202 “Conserving and enhancing the historic environment” of the National Planning Policy Framework have been consulted while considering the application proposals together with the Bowdon Conservation Area Appraisal and CA management Plan.

Text: Proposals The property is not listed and features, albeit minimally, in the Bowdon Conservation Area history.

Text: Proposals The property consists of the main house; a four-storey detached dwelling, with further single storey accommodation to the side providing an open plan sun lounge and breakfast area with various configurations of three adjoined roof types; flat roof with lantern, pitch roof with small dormer and a lean-two structure to the rear. The opposite side of the plot includes a double garage with storage and terrace above. Built in Cheshire brick, the use of dark and red stocks for decoration and detailing. Existing stone cills are painted. The basements form additional habitable space with existing light wells providing natural daylight.

Text: Proposals The scale and massing within this character zone is larger that of Character Zone B with plot sizes larger and the heights of the structures greater, which also encompasses a variety in terms of size and style, both in the original structures and as a result of subsequent re-development. See diagram 2 Character Zone below.

Text: Proposals Diagram 2 & 3. Bowdon Conservation Area - Character Zones & Buildings Dates

Text: Proposals The single storey accommodation formed part of the works carried out by a previous owner/architect – application no. H/46630 (decision date 20th January 1999) for the erection of single storey side extension and first floor rear extension to form additional living accommodation following the demolition of the existing conservatory. Conversion of the existing outhouse to form guest accommodation and erection of an extension to outhouse to form double garage and storage area with terrace above. Extension of existing basement to form practice studio.

Text: Design Design Proposals

Text: Design The proposal includes partial demolition of the existing side extension and erection of a new single side extension providing extended living accommodation. To the rear new extended single storey extension forming a larger kitchen/ breakfast area with a partial first floor extension to the family bathroom.

Text: Design The existing side extension was a later addition by the previous owners and is to be partially demolished as the origi- nal build materials have not stood the test of time. This demolition and replacement is inevitable.

Text: Design The partial rebuild of the side extension will be marginally larger in footprint by 12.6sq.m / 135sq.ft. and will be built using reclaimed Cheshire brick and flush mortar joints to match the existing dwelling and keyed in the coursing.

Text: Design Introduction of new windows in the style of main house and an opportunity to introduce further natural light into the interior. The original inglenook fireplace to be retained and the existing chimney taken down to a appropriate level to allow for a black external flue liner to be installed. The new pitched roof will be installed along the full length of exten- sion, the main living space will have a vaulted ceiling with recessed conservation roof lights surrounded by natural reclaimed /new grey slate tiles. Over the utility room a flat ceiling. On the front gable elevation the introduction of a new small window above the door in the style of an existing window to the main house.

Text: Design To the rear a new extended single storey extension forming a larger kitchen/breakfast area with a partial first floor extension to the family bathroom again in matching Cheshire brick with windows and French patio doors to match the style of the existing painted timber frames. The footprint of this element of extension would be 17sq.m / 182sq.ft. Roofing these two parts will consist of:

Text: Design Ground floor—flat sedum green roof with a fixed roof light over the kitchen area.

Text: Design First floor—mono pitched slate roof to tie-in with the existing pitch roof of the existing two storey extension to achieve the same pitch. We undertook various case studies of roof configuration and decided on this option, which was more in keeping aesthetically. We have reused the existing window taken out to form new door opening in the new extension.

Text: Design We also reviewed the opportunity to put a mono-pitch roof over the kitchen, but decided that this would have a large impact on the existing large window/door to the master en-suite and would also limit the position of the air source heat pump system (currently submitted on a previous application).

Text: Design Following an informal consultation with the planner and Heritage Officer this week, we have taken on-board all the comments where possible and adhered this to the scheme.

Text: Design Use

Text: Design The use of the property as a domestic residence will remain unaltered.

Text: Layout Layout

Text: Layout The proposed new extensions will be marginally larger in foot-print by 29.6sq.m / 318sq.ft to the original and main- taining a similar height through the new pitched roof of the original roof.

Text: Layout The site is surrounded on three sides by the neighbouring properties, the proposed works with have no visible impact on the neighbours, but will improve on the look and function of the poorly designed side extension that has been en- dured over the past 20 years.

Text: Landscaping The materials proposed for the side and rear extensions is stated above.

Text: Landscaping Access

Text: Landscaping The current access will be maintained as existing,

Text: Landscaping The parking will also remain unaltered on the existing driveway and in the double garage.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion The proposed new extensions will have a positive impact on the positive contributor within the conservation area of Bowdon and removes and realigns this poor quality addition by a previous owner.

Text: Conclusion The proposed materials will match existing where appropriate and the new side extension has been carefully de- signed to respect the original building and the local context. The extensions will preserve the character and appear- ance of The Bowdon Conservation Area, therefore, the proposal passes the statutory test in Section 72 of the Plan- ning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990.

Text: Conclusion It is considered that the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF and Core Strategy Policies and planning permission should be granted.
