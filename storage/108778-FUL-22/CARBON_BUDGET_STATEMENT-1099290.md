Text: 2 Terms of Reference 2 Terms of Reference

Text: 2 Terms of Reference This Carbon Budget Statement seeks to demonstrate that the design intent for the scheme as well as the commitment to aligning with Trafford Councils aspirations and wishes to deliver sustainable developments. The environmental and energy strategy for the scheme has been developed using the following regulations and planning policies:

Text: 2.1 Building Regulations 2.1 Building Regulations

Text: 2.1 Building Regulations The Building Regulations Approved Document Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) 2021 outline the requirements for reductions in carbon emissions and primary energy required for new developments.

Text: 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012) 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012)

Text: 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012) Planning applications are currently assessed against the Core Strategy which sets out an overarching strategy and development principles for Trafford to guide development until at least 2026. The relevant policies are extracted from the Local Plan Strategy Document:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Major built development proposals will be required to demonstrate how they will seek to minimise their contribution towards and/or mitigate their effects on climate change, in line with both national standards and local opportunities and programmes. For the purposes of this policy, “major development” is defned as comprising:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Residential development equal to or greater than 10 units; and

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Non-Residential development above a threshold of 1,000m2 floor area.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Development will need to demonstrate how it contributes towards reducing CO2 emissions within the Borough. This should include incorporating measures such as applying sustainable design and construction techniques prior to utilising renewable energy generation technologies, examples of which can be found in the supporting Technical Note.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The policy provides targets for major development to deliver different CO2 reduction targets as follows:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGAs) - where there is potential to deliver CO2 reduction target of up to 15% above current Building Regulations; and

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Outside LCGAs - where there is potential to deliver CO2 reduction target of up to 5% above current Building Regulations.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change CO2 emissions should be reduced by applying the following hierarchy:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 1. Design and construction techniques to reduce the demand for energy (for example: through the orientation of building; internal layout; and superior energy efficiency measures such as extra insulation);

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2. Technology (for example through sourcing low carbon or renewable energy generation, including any district energy network which may be accessible).

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The Trafford Low Carbon Study (2011) identified opportunities across the Borough to reduce CO2 emissions by more than the national standards. In key areas of the Borough identified as Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGA’s) the reduction could be up to 15%, dependent on the nature of the

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change © Clancy Consulting 2020

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Page 6 of 25

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change development being proposed. The LCGAs identified are Altrincham Town Centre, Carrington and Trafford Park.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The Trafford Low Carbon Study (2011) details that up to 5% CO2 reduction above national standards can be achieved outside of LCGAs where realistic opportunities exist to connect to existing low/zero carbon energy generating facility(s).

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.2.2 Pollution

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Development that has potential to cause adverse pollution (of air, light, water, ground), noise or vibration will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that adequate mitigation measures can be put in place.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Where development is proposed close to existing sources of pollution, noise or vibration, developers will be required to demonstrate that it is sited and designed in such a way as to confine the impact of nuisance from these sources to acceptable levels appropriate to the proposed use concerned.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Within the Borough’s Air Quality Management Zones developers will be required to adopt measures identified in the Greater Manchester Air Quality Action Plan, to ensure that their development would not have an adverse impact on the air quality.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.3 SPD1: Planning Obligations Technical Note 3: Climate Change (Feb 2012)

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change This document is a supporting technical note for the core strategy climate change policy L5 and Planning Obligations SPD1.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change This document confirms that areas of high development growth termed Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGAs) have been identified to have the potential to deliver higher carbon emissions reduction targets of up to 15% above current Building Regulations, with the rest of the Borough to deliver up to 5% above current Building Regulations.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change This document also requires a Carbon Budget Statement (CBS) for any proposed development and provides a template of how the CBS should be presented.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy 3.1 Energy Hierarchy

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy This development follows the principles to make the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the following energy hierarchy:

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be lean: use less energy

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be clean: supply energy efficiently

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be green: use renewable energy

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy 3.2 New Residential Buildings

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The intention is to adopt an enhanced building fabric based on values which are better than the minimum required for compliance with Building Regulations AD Part L 2021 as outlined in Table A below. This will minimise the building energy demand and contribute towards Building Regulations compliance.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Page 8 of 25

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Furthermore, efficient systems will be adopted as outlined in Table B below to minimise the building energy consumption and contribute further towards a passive and sustainable building which is compliant with Building Regulations.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Description System Heating/Cooling Variable Refrigerant flow (VRF) Heating & Cooling System Heating Only Electric Panel Heaters Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (Min 75% Ventilation efficiency) with specific fan power of 1.6 W/(l/s) Hot Water Assumed 16No 10 litre point of use water heaters Allowance included for PV panels of 50m2 (full feasibility and Renewable Energy requirement for building regulations to be reviewed during detail design) All general lighting to achieve 100 luminaire lumens / circuit Lighting Watt

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Table B – Proposed efficient building services system

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The proposal is to provide a fabric first solution by minimising heat loss through the thermal elements. Heating will be provided by a Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) System and direct electric heating for small spaces. A small PV array will be utilised to meet compliance with the Planning Requirement.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The building has been modelled in IES VE software to assess the performance of the building against Part L (See Section 7 for Part L BRUKL document).

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The assessment showed that 10kWp of PV panels would be required to exceed the 15% improvement on building regulations required by planning; with an actual improvement of 16.9%. This would equate to 50m2 panel area at an efficiency of 20%. The photovoltaic panels could be positioned on the roof as shown below, so that it would not be seen from ground level

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Page 9 of 25

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The above parameters (outlined in Table A and Table B) offer a Building Regulations / SBEM and planning compliant solution for the proposed development.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy During the design stage, the proposals will be subject to more refined modelling based on the final building form, construction details and building services systems to optimise the design. It is proposed to fully review the inclusion of photovoltaic panels at this stage to best suit the scheme.

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution 4 Consideration for Pollution

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution There will be no energy generation from gas or other fossil or solid fuel (eg Biomass) associated with regulated building services and therefore there are no additional local pollutants generated from equipment flues associated with the building services within these buildings.

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution Ventilation provided to the building is via Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR). This provides a ‘best practice’ ventilation strategy according to the Energy Saving Trust, which controls indoor pollutes more adequately from volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), allergens (e.g. dust mites), odours from cooking and bodies, moisture etc.

Text: 5 Conclusion 5 Conclusion

Text: 5 Conclusion The analysis shows that the proposed all electric building takes advantage of the de carbonisation of the grid, reducing the carbon emissions significantly closer to net zero than a building which uses gas for heating and hot water.

Text: 5 Conclusion The buildings exclude the use of combustion equipment for providing space heating and hot water and therefore there will be no additional local pollution sources associated with the building services.

Text: 5 Conclusion The Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) ‘best practice’ ventilation strategy will provide the best internal environment for occupants

Text: 5 Conclusion The information obtained from the current design activity demonstrates that a building complying with Building Regulations AD Part L and planning requirements of a CO2 reduction target of up to 15% above current Building Regulations as required for a Low Carbon Growth Areas. Initial SBEM calculations showed that the building achieved a 16.9% improvement on building regulations, when constructed utilising the fabric performance values outlined in Table A and the system performance parameters outlined in Table B above.
