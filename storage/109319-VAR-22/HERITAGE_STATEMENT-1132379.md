Text: 3.1 PLANNING HISTORY – (LAST 10 YEARS) INCLUDING ADJACENT SITES. The Conservation Area is named after The Devisdale, an historic area of unenclosed flat land on the summit of Bowdon Hill. The Conservation Area includes the steeper, more wooded north slope of Bowdon Hill and the gentler west slope descending towards Dunham Massey. The area was located within the township of Dunham Massey and its identity can be seen as an extension of Dunham Park. The map of the left hand side shows that the original Silverlands building was built between 1835-1877 and the ancillary building named as the ‘Coach House’ to which this application relates, was built between 1936-1967. Silverlands itself was replaced by a more modern building.

Text: 3.1 PLANNING HISTORY – (LAST 10 YEARS) INCLUDING ADJACENT SITES. The planning of the area was closely controlled by the Earl of Stamford to create an appropriate social neighbourhood to nearby Dunham Park. Its development in the second half of the 19th century was characterised by houses on a grand scale, set in large plots at a low density with magnificent gardens, sweeping drives and coach houses for the ‘Cottontots’. This development was a consequence of the advent of the railway to nearby Altrincham in 1849 and Hale in 1862, prosperity in Manchester and the desire to move to healthier surroundings among those who could afford to.

Text: 3.1 PLANNING HISTORY – (LAST 10 YEARS) INCLUDING ADJACENT SITES. The area was from Victorian times characterised by a lively and vigorous social, sporting, intellectual and artistic community life. While there was extensive social mixing between Bowdon and Dunham, social events would have taken place in the large houses. The spacious grounds often included croquet lawns, later tennis courts – apparently at one time there were over 70 private croquet lawns in Bowdon. Bowdon Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1877.

Text: 3.1 PLANNING HISTORY – (LAST 10 YEARS) INCLUDING ADJACENT SITES. While some of the roads and paths date back to earlier periods, many of the roads were laid down at the time of the Victorian development and bear the names of the ancestors and place names associated with the Stamford family Although it overlays the earlier Turf Lane, St Margaret’s Road is an example of Victorian suburban planning, with its gently curved length lined with trees. The area is bisected by Dunham Road, including the section historically known as Shepherd’s Brow.

Text: 3.1 PLANNING HISTORY – (LAST 10 YEARS) INCLUDING ADJACENT SITES. The ‘Coach House’ is one of the smallest buildings in the area. The image to right shows the whole site area outlined in red, as you can see the ‘Coach House’ is initially hard to see amongst the tree canopies and foliage.

Text: 5.1 LAYOUT 5.1 LAYOUT

Text: 5.1 LAYOUT The proposed layout is largely dictated by existing boundary constraints and the layout of the site. The proposed external car park spaces are situated to the front of the application site within a clearance in the existing foliage and trees. Existing vehicular access to the application site will also be retained.

Text: 5.1 LAYOUT Appropriate space and width will be given around all sides of the building, so it’s commensurate with the building in the surrounding area and meets with existing High Standards of light, privacy and space, without affected existing arrangements or changing the existing structure. The proposed rear single storey extension layout position achieves both privacy from the neighbouring dwelling but also provides an exceptional view of the private garden area.

Text: 5.2 APPEARANCE 5.2 APPEARANCE

Text: 5.2 APPEARANCE The now proposed front elevation fronting Devisdale Road which as existing is the rear elevation, has been largely unchanged, with exception to a porch area which has be carefully designed to match the existing aspects of the building. Also the additional of another small dormer window which is to match the existing one present on the left hand side of the building to give the building greater symmetry. The building has been treated like a heritage asset and the proposals have taken this into account. The use on small sandstone blocks and Welsh slate has been implemented to match the existing characteristics of the building and local architecture. The style and appearance of the building has been maintained and improved, the longevity of the building would be prolonged by the proposal as the building will potentially fall into a state of disrepair if it remains uninhabited.

Text: 5.2 APPEARANCE Though the front door, positioned centrally on the front elevation, a porch area flooded by light accesses onto a landing area allowing habitants to either go upstairs to first floor which is occupied by three spacious en-suite bedrooms, or downstairs to an open plan kitchen/diner. A lobby area which the utility, WC and lounge can be accessed.

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING The proposals are comprehensive and retain the best features of the site, whilst enhancing the setting as a whole. A new hedge boundary consisting of Beech, Laurel and Holly will be erected around the proposed site. The proposed development will be accompanied with a landscaping scheme to reflect and enhance the qualities of the area. Provide private garden space has been allocated within the development to increase the levels of green space and improve upon existing levels of quality landscaping.

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING The general scale of the built context is low, with only 28m² in total of additional floor space, also the existing building has been kept entirely intact, the proposal utilises existing openings and structure for the proposal.

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING _____________________________________________________________________

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING The nature of traffic in and out of the site will be modified slightly as there would be additional habitants to the currently vacant ‘Coach House’. The gates and gatepost will remain unchanged, the low stone wall on the site will also remain intact apart from a small 3.5m section to access the proposed car park area. The parking area will be well screened from the street scene by existing trees and new hedges.

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING The application site is well accessed from Devisdale road. Major transport routes can be accessed quickly from Devisdale road which can lead directly to A56 Dunham Road and M56.

Text: 5.3 LANDSCAPING Existing vehicular access is maintained from Devisdale Road. Pedestrian access can be gained from the front and is maintained throughout the whole of the development.

In carrying out the ‘planning balance’ required by Para.196 of the NPPF, the provisions of Para.11(d) of the NPPF are engaged as there are no adverse impacts which would outweigh the benefits arising from these proposals. The proposal will have no effect on existing street scenes, not only is the proposal redeveloping an existing building which doesn’t involve and increase in height. The proposal is actually screened from the public road/paths and won’t be seen by the general public.
