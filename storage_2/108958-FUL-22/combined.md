Text: Description Description

Text: Description Please describe details of the proposed development or works including any change of use

Text: Description Planning Portal Reference: PP-11486114

Text: Description The proposal involves the use of the existing B2 classified vacant unit (240sqm) to create a microbrewery with ancillary brewery shop and tap room within Class B2 – General industrial. There will be no major development works onsite. We will install a 10bbl brewing kit comprising 6 vessels/tanks ranging in size 1,800-2,200L.

Text: Description The site is located on an industrial estate. Given the layout and orientation (away from local residential property) we anticipate that neighbouring businesses and residents further away are unlikely to be aware of or be harmed by the trade associated with our business.

Text: Description We plan to install a cold room onsite along with a bar shop area which will help support tours, tastings and more general visits as per the original site. A licensing application (ref trafford-1258321) has been submitted to Trafford Council to support this with the consultation period end 2/9/2022. To date there have no representations. We are due to begin our lease on 1/9/2022 and plan to commence these works from that date.

Text: Description The premises will be used first and foremost as a microbrewery, producing, packaging and delivering beer wholesale. A core range of cask and keg beers will be sold to pubs within the Altrincham, Trafford, Greater Manchester area and beyond. We expect the ancillary brewery shop and taproom to increase revenue and viability of the brewery. It will also provide a point of interest to the wider area in the form of brewery tours and educational visits without having any impact on the amenity of neighbours or neighbouring businesses.

Text: Description An ancillary shop and taproom is a common feature of microbreweries. It helps generate additional income via various revenue streams. Our experience from our previous location suggests it’ll be frequented by those interested in the quality of the product and interest in the brewing process. As such, we do not consider our on/off license customers to be a source of noise or disturbance that will impact neighbour amenity. In our experience, due to the nature of the product (a relatively expensive craft beer), the demographic of people purchasing onsite poses little risk in terms of them going on to partake in crime or disorder. The demographic of our onsite customers is a mix of typically local men and women (ages 35-65) often with families.

Text: Description Historically we've drawn interest and visitors to the Trafford/Altrincham area. This proposal will initially create 2 full time jobs along with multiple part time roles, bringing back a vacant industrial unit into effective use. The Microbrewing industry is a rapidly expanding market and the proposal seeks to build on the interest generated when pre-covid-19 we were finalists in CAMRAs "Best Bottled Beer in Britain" for 2020.

Text: Description With plans to open up the area along the canal nearby with a new cycle/footbridge in 2023 we believe we're well placed to help ensure the Broadheath/Timperley stretch of the Bridgwater Canal can thrive in future.

Text: Industrial or Commercial Processes and Machinery Does this proposal involve the carrying out of industrial or commercial activities and processes?

Text: Industrial or Commercial Processes and Machinery O ONo

Text: Industrial or Commercial Processes and Machinery Please describe the activities and processes which would be carried out on the site and the end products including plant, ventilation or air conditioning. Please include the type of machinery which may be installed on site:

Text: Industrial or Commercial Processes and Machinery This proposal is to set up a microbrewery onsite. The brewing, fermentation, packaging and storage of beer will be the key aspects of the business. We will be installing a 10bbl (1500L) brewing kit comprising 6 vessels/tanks ranging in size 1,800L-2,200. C02 is a byproduct of the process itself but is released in minimal levels due to the size of our brewing equipment. The brewing kit will be set-up close to the main exit for the building and CO2 will be released naturally to the general atmosphere. One small vent will be required above our boiler which will expel straight to air. Again, the size of our brewing kit dictates that the steam expelled will be of little consequence to the surrounding area.
