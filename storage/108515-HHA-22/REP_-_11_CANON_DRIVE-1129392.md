Text: Comment Details Comment Reasons:

Text: Comment Details Comment:The rear of No. 19 Oakwood Lane at first floor level is clearly visible from my property. The work that is on-going now appears different from that envisaged as I interpret the proposed first floor plans for the extension submitted in June/July 2022.

Text: Comment Details Has there been a change approved.? I see that the application is listed on the Weekly List for Oct 24th 2022.

Text: Comment Details I also notice that the status of the application is listed as "awaiting decision". I need some more information during the consultation period so as to decide whether I have any objections.

Text: Comment Details Thanks.
