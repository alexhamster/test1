Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: Introduction 1.1. This Heritage Assessment has been commissioned by Chi Yip (Altrincham) Ltd to consider the proposed external alterations to 7 Cross Street, Altrincham (hereafter also referred to as ‘the site’) as shown on the Site Location Plan below (Plate 1). The Assessment has also been prepared to fulfil the following request from Trafford Council:

Text: Introduction “As the application is either in a Conservation Area or affects a Listed Building, you will be required to submit a Heritage Assessment. The Heritage assessment must include a two stage process; an assessment of the significance of the affected heritage asset(s) and the impact of the proposed development on that significance including any measures to mitigate potential harm and/or better reveal significance.”

Text: Introduction 1.2. 7 Cross Street is not a heritage asset (designated or non-designated) but is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area.

Text: Introduction This Heritage Assessment has been undertaken in line with the Methodology set out in Appendix 1 and it has been informed by all relevant legislation and planning policy as set out in Appendices 2 to 4.

Text: Site Description Site Description

Text: Site Description 7 Cross Street is a late 20th-century building of two storeys (Plate 2-Plate 4). It is faced in red multi stock brick and covered with a tiled mansard roof. The building principally fronts onto Cross Street with the main entrance positioned in the central canted bay. A secondary western elevation faces Brewery Street. The building is horizontally and vertically articulated with corbelled and projecting brickwork, and the central bay is surmounted by a moulded concrete pediment. Windows and doors are modern glazed units, and modern retail signage has been applied to the street-facing facades.

Text: Historic Development and Planning History The 1876–78 Ordnance Survey Town Plan for Altrincham (Plate 5) records that the site was then occupied by different buildings and its surrounds were less developed. The area to the east and north-east was characterised by open ground and gardens and there was a Gas Company’s Office on the opposite side of the road (which was then named ‘Moss Lane’).

Text: Historic Development and Planning History 2.3. By 1938, there had been no discernible change to the layout of the site nor the general footprint of the buildings contained within (Plate 6). On the other hand, its immediate surrounds had become markedly more built-up as a result of new development to the south and east.

Text: Historic Development and Planning History The 1965–85 Ordnance Survey map (Plate 7) records a rear extension to No. 9 Cross Street which extended behind No. 7, but otherwise no notable change to the layout of the site. Properties in the immediate vicinity had been rebuilt, and a new road (‘The Causeway’) laid out to the south-west.

Text: Historic Development and Planning History 2.4.

Text: Historic Development and Planning History 2.5. The buildings within the site have since been demolished and replaced with the existing retail premises (see ‘Planning History’).

Text: Planning History Planning History

Text: Planning History Planning history records for the site, which are accessible online via the Trafford Council website, indicate numerous subsequent alterations to the site. In 1987, planning permission was granted for the demolition of the existing buildings that occupied 7–11 Cross Street and their replacement with a two-storey retail premises (LPA ref. H24661). Since then, there have been several approved applications for the change of use of the site and external alterations, including changes to openings and signage. The site has most recently served as a Tim Hortons Café and Bake Shop (LPA ref. 92855/FUL/17).

Text: 3. Development Proposals 3.1. The proposed external alterations to 7 Cross Street are summarised on the Proposed Elevations drawing (drawing no. 040_PLN_300, rev. P01) and comprise:

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New aluminium panel (painted in RAL 9004) to main entrance with new signage to be installed.

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New automatic double doors to main entrance (powder coated aluminium RAL 9004).

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New ground-floor brick pillar to the southern elevation to match with the existing.

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New ground-floor easternmost bay of the southern elevation to be installed with timber framed fixed window, aluminium panels (powder coated RAL 3002), a new servery hatch, and new illuminated signage.

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New wall-mounted, double-sided and illuminated signage (white internally illuminated LED text only) to be applied either side of the main entrance.

Text: 3. Development Proposals • New aluminium panels to be added below ground-floor southern elevation windows (colour to match signage panel above windows).

Text: 3. Development Proposals • Existing signage applied to brickwork of ground-floor western elevation to be removed.

Text: 3. Development Proposals 3.2. The site is a modern, late 20th-century property that possesses no heritage significance, therefore there is no heritage constraint to the proposed internal alterations and these works are not assessed below.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4. Significance of the Historic Environment

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.1. The site is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. The Conservation Area has been appraised and assessed as part of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal (SNRCAA) and the Stamford New Road Conservation Area Management Plan (SNRCAMP).1

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment With regard to other heritage assets within the surrounds of the site, Step 1 of the methodology recommended by GPA3 (see methodology), is to identify which heritage assets might be affected by a proposed development. 2 Development proposals may adversely impact heritage assets where they remove a feature which contributes to the significance of a heritage asset, or where they interfere with an element of a heritage asset's setting which contributes to its significance, such as interrupting a key relationship or a designed view.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.2.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment It is however widely accepted (paragraph 207 of the NPPF) that not all parts of a heritage asset will necessarily be of equal significance.3 In some cases, certain elements of a heritage asset can accommodate substantial changes whilst preserving the significance of the asset. Significance can be derived from many elements, including the historic fabric of a building or elements of its surrounds.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.3.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.4. Consideration, based upon professional judgement and on-site analysis, was therefore made as to whether any of the heritage assets present within the surrounding area (see Plate 8 below) may include the site as part of their setting, whether the site contributes to their overall heritage significance, and whether the assets may potentially be affected by the proposed scheme as a result.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4–6 Cross Street is a late 19th-century, two-storey building of polychromatic brick construction located on the opposite side of Cross Street (south-west of the site). The SNRCAA identifies Nos. 4–6 as a positive contributor to the Conservation Area, therefore it has the potential to be regarded as a non-designated heritage asset.4 Rather than providing an independent setting assessment for the building, any impact of the proposals will be considered as part of the general assessment of the views within and towards the Conservation Area.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.5.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment Other nearby heritage assets include the George Street Conservation Area, the Grade II listed Stamford House (NHLE 1084311) and the Grade II listed Station Hotel (NHLE 1346199); however, due to the nature and very limited scale of the proposals, it is not considered proportionate to take these assets forward for further setting assessment.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.6.

Text: 4. Significance of the Historic Environment 4.7. Therefore, besides the Stamford New Road Conservation Area (including any historic built form within it), no other heritage assets have been taken forward for individual assessment.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.8. The Stamford New Road Conservation Area was first designated by Trafford Council on 16th June 1987.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area Statement of significance

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.9. The SNRCAA summarises the special interest, and hence the heritage significance, of the Conservation Area as follows:

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area “• Building elevations fronting the street display a variety of good quality architectural styles, detailing and expression, particularly to upper floors, which contribute a high level of aesthetic and historic value to the Conservation Area. There are a number of consistent design details for example the use of splayed corners and plaques with names, initial and dates displayed

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • Generally buildings sited along Railway Street are 2 storeys in height and domestic in scale increasing to 3 storeys and a larger scale along Stamford New Road and some adjoining streets. Buildings tend to be traditional in form with pitched roofs, and front the street. In a number of cases the plot ratio is greater in depth than width, although there are some exceptions. The scale, massing and form

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area | P22-2067 | JT | August 2022 | 7 Cross Street, Altrincham

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 9

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area of buildings results in a strong building line and sense of enclosure, this contributes to the visual interest and rhythm of the streetscene.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • There are a number of significant pedestrian routes, ginnels and open spaces which contribute to the finer grain and spatial interest of the Conservation Area. There are often good views from these routes to the plainer, often unaltered and functional historic rear elevations, outriggers and outbuildings which contribute positively to the integrity and evolution of the Conservation Area.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • The consistent use of traditional building materials and local details repeated throughout the Conservation Area provides a sense of visual harmony. The majority of buildings are constructed from red brick laid in traditional bonds with pitched blue slate roofs and painted timber windows. There is variation in the tonal range of red brick and embellishment is usually picked out in terracotta, gauged brick or sandstone. There are smaller numbers of buildings constructed from sandstone or white brick.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • The area is defined by the railway, both historically and physically. Railway Street was renamed in 1849 with the advent of the railway. Stamford New Road was created after 1880 when Altrincham and Bowdon Station replaced the two earlier stations. The name declares the importance of the Earl of Stamford as a major landowner in the area. In the second half of 20th century Altrincham Station was developed to accommodate a significant transport interchange and in 2014 undergoing major refurbishment.”

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area Ultimately, it is clear that the Conservation Area principally derives significance from intrinsic elements of its character and appearance, which include historic buildings, traditional materials, elements of its layout, and historic aspects of land use.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.10.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.11. The setting of the Conservation Area also contributes to its significance, although to a considerably lesser degree than elements of its intrinsic character and appearance. Positive elements of setting include:

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • Sections of the railway line which lie immediately outside the designation area but can be experienced in junction with it; and

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area • Historic elements of the settlement core of Altrincham which adjoin and can be directly experienced in conjunction with the designation area, much of which is contained within the boundaries of the George Street Conservation Area, the Old Market Conservation Area, the Goose Green Conservation Area, and The Downs Conservation Area.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 10

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area Any contribution of the site to character and appearance

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area The site is located within the central part of the Conservation Area (see Plate 8 above). As a late 20th-century, purpose-built retail premises of modern red multi stock brick construction, the building does not form part of the historic building stock within the Conservation Area, nor does it contribute to any of the elements of special interest identified. The corner position of the building means that it is especially prominent in views along Cross Street and east-facing views into the Conservation Area from the west (Plate 9).

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.12.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 7 Cross Street was described in the SNRCAMP at a time when the premises were vacant:

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area “Late 20th century development at the junction of Cross Street is less successful and looks somewhat dated, such as the building on the corner of Brewery Street and Cross Street. The structure on Cross Street does not integrate with its surroundings and is currently vacant.”5

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area | P22-2067 | JT | August 2022 | 7 Cross Street, Altrincham

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 11

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area The building is no longer vacant and its external appearance has since been altered with new signage and the insertion of additional glazing on the western facade, as approved through planning application 92855/FUL/17. The Case Officer for this application concluded as follows:

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.14.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area “The proposed shop front is considered to be in keeping with other similar themed commercial units within the vicinity of the site and the wider Conservation Area as a whole. It is therefore considered that the development would have a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the application site and the wider Stamford New Road Conservation Area.”

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.15. Despite these enhancements, elements of the building remain incongruous with the local vernacular, namely the colour of the brickwork and the style and proportions of the fenestration, especially the large, irregular expanse of glazing at ground-floor level.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 4.16. Therefore, the site is considered to slightly detract from the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 12

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5. Assessment of Impacts

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts The proposals represent a reduction in the total amount of signage present on the building, and most new signage will replace existing, except where a modest panel is proposed above the new servery hatch in the easternmost bay. With regard to previous planning application 92855/FUL/17, the Council judged modern signage to be in keeping with the other themed commercial units in the vicinity and in the Conservation Area as a whole. The new signage will be comparatively modern, but the lettering more minimalist and muted when compared to the bright red calligraphic lettering that currently characterises the building. The proposed illuminated signage will be modest. Therefore, the replacement signage will be appropriate given the town centre location and existing retail use of the site.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.1.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts The new aluminium panels will be dark grey and dark red. These will replace existing panels which are light cream and lighter grey in colour. Therefore, the new panels will be more muted in colour, reducing the overall visual impact of the building in street scenes.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.2.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.3. The creation of the ground-floor serving hatch will enhance the proportions and fenestration of the principal southern elevation of the building by creating a new easternmost bay that is articulated by a brick pier. This will break up the large expanse of glazing on the eastern side of the elevation and result in a more symmetrical facade.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.4.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts All new/replacement windows and doors will be high specification timber and aluminium frame units. Aluminium frame glazing was previously approved as part of application 92855/FUL/17. Ultimately, the proposed glazing equates to high-quality replacement that will cause no harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts Overall, the proposals represent an improvement when compared to the baseline conditions of the site and the changes approved as part of application 92855/FUL/17, which were then judged by the Council to enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.5.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 5.6. For these reasons, the proposals are anticipated to positively enhance the external appearance of the building and the contribution that it makes to the character and appearance of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area by ameliorating the external appearance of the building, especially in views along Cross Street.

Text: 5. Assessment of Impacts 13

Text: 6. Conclusions 6. Conclusions

Text: 6. Conclusions This Heritage Assessment has concluded that the proposals would cause no harm to the significance of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. The external appearance of 7 Cross Street would be ameliorated by the proposed changes to the signage and fenestration, resulting in an enhancement to the character and appearance of the designation area.

Text: 6. Conclusions 6.1.

Text: 6. Conclusions 6.2. No other heritage assets in the vicinity of the site are considered to be sensitive to the proposals.

Text: 6. Conclusions 6.3. The proposals are therefore compliant with all relevant heritage legislation and national and local planning policy.

Text: Assessment of significance Assessment of significance

Text: Assessment of significance In the NPPF, heritage significance is defined as:

Text: Assessment of significance “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting. For World Heritage Sites, the cultural value described within each site’s Statement of Outstanding Universal Value forms part of its significance.”6

Text: Assessment of significance Historic England's GPA:2 gives advice on the assessment of significance as part of the application process. It advises understanding the nature, extent, and level of significance of a heritage asset.7

Text: Assessment of significance In order to do this, GPA 2 also advocates considering the four types of heritage value an asset may hold, as identified in English Heritage’s Conservation Principles.8 These essentially cover the heritage ‘interests’ given in the glossaries of the NPPF and the PPG which are archaeological, architectural and artistic, and historic.9

Text: Assessment of significance The PPG provides further information on the interests it identifies:

Text: Assessment of significance • Archaeological interest: As defined in the Glossary to the National Planning Policy Framework, there will be archaeological interest in a heritage asset if it holds, or potentially holds, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point.

Text: Assessment of significance • Architectural and artistic interest: These are interests in the design and general aesthetics of a place. They can arise from conscious design or fortuitously from the way the heritage asset has evolved. More specifically, architectural interest is an interest in the art or science of the design, construction, craftsmanship and decoration of buildings and structures of all types. Artistic interest is an interest in other human creative skills, like sculpture.

Text: Assessment of significance • Historic interest: An interest in past lives and events (including pre-historic). Heritage assets can illustrate or be associated with them. Heritage assets with historic interest not only provide a material record of our nation’s history, but can also provide meaning for communities derived from their collective experience of a place and can symbolise wider values such as faith and cultural identity.10

Text: Assessment of significance Significance results from a combination of any, some, or all of the interests described above.

Text: Assessment of significance 7 Historic England, GPA:2.

Text: Assessment of significance 8 Historic England, Conservation Principles: Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment (London, April 2008).

Text: Assessment of significance Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas are generally designated for their special architectural and historic interest. Scheduling is predominantly, although not exclusively, associated with archaeological interest.

Text: Setting and significance Setting and significance

Text: Setting and significance As defined in the NPPF:

Text: “Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”12 “Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”12

Text: “Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”12 Setting is defined as:

Text: “Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”12 “The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral.”13

Text: “Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”12 Therefore, setting can contribute to, affect an appreciation of significance, or be neutral with regards to heritage values.

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting Assessing change through alteration to setting

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting How setting might contribute to these values has been assessed within this Report with reference to GPA:3, particularly the checklist given on page 11. This advocates the clear articulation of “what matters and why”.14

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting In GPA:3, a stepped approach is recommended, of which Step 1 is to identify which heritage assets and their settings are affected. Step 2 is to assess whether, how and to what degree settings make a contribution to the significance of the heritage asset(s) or allow significance to be appreciated. The guidance includes a (non-exhaustive) checklist of elements of the physical surroundings of an asset that might be considered when undertaking the assessment including, among other things: topography, other heritage assets, green space, functional relationships and degree of change over time. It also lists aspects associated with the experience of the asset which might be considered, including: views, intentional intervisibility, tranquillity, sense of enclosure, accessibility, rarity and land use.

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting Step 3 is to assess the effect of the proposed development on the significance of the asset(s). Step 4 is to explore ways to maximise enhancement and minimise harm. Step 5 is to make and document the decision and monitor outcomes.

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting 16

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting A Court of Appeal judgement has confirmed that whilst issues of visibility are important when assessing setting, visibility does not necessarily confer a contribution to significance and factors other than visibility should also be considered, with Lindblom LJ stating at paragraphs 25 and 26 of the judgement (referring to an earlier Court of Appeal judgement):

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting Paragraph 25 – “But – again in the particular context of visual effects – I said that if “a proposed development is to affect the setting of a listed building there must be a distinct visual relationship of some kind between the two – a visual relationship which is more than remote or ephemeral, and which in some way bears on one’s experience of the listed building in its surrounding landscape or townscape” (paragraph 56)”.

Text: Assessing change through alteration to setting Paragraph 26 – “This does not mean, however, that factors other than the visual and physical must be ignored when a decision-maker is considering the extent of a listed building’s setting. Generally, of course, the decision-maker will be concentrating on visual and physical considerations, as in Williams (see also, for example, the first instance judgment in R. (on the application of Miller) v North Yorkshire County Council [2009] EWHC 2172 (Admin), at paragraph 89). But it is clear from the relevant national policy and guidance to which I have referred, in particular the guidance in paragraph 18a-013-20140306 of the PPG, that the Government recognizes the potential relevance of other considerations – economic, social and historical. These other considerations may include, for example, “the historic relationship between places”. Historic England’s advice in GPA3 was broadly to the same effect.” 15

Text: Levels of significance Levels of significance

Text: Levels of significance Descriptions of significance will naturally anticipate the ways in which impacts will be considered. Hence descriptions of the significance of Conservation Areas will make reference to their special interest and character and appearance, and the significance of Listed Buildings will be discussed with reference to the building, its setting and any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.

Text: Levels of significance In accordance with the levels of significance articulated in the NPPF and the PPG, three levels of significance are identified:

Text: Levels of significance • Designated heritage assets of the highest significance, as identified in paragraph 200 of the NPPF, comprising Grade I and II* Listed buildings, Grade I and II* Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments, Protected Wreck Sites, World Heritage Sites and Registered Battlefields (and also including some Conservation Areas) and non-designated heritage assets of archaeological interest which are demonstrably of equivalent significance to Scheduled Monuments, as identified in footnote 68 of the NPPF;16

Text: Levels of significance • Designated heritage assets of less than the highest significance, as identified in paragraph 200 of the NPPF, comprising Grade II Listed buildings and Grade II Registered Parks and Gardens (and also some Conservation Areas);17 and

Text: Levels of significance | P22-2067 | JT | August 2022 | 7 Cross Street, Altrincham

Text: Levels of significance 17

Text: Levels of significance • Non-designated heritage assets. Non-designated heritage assets are defined within the PPG as “buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified by plan-making bodies as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, but which do not meet the criteria for designated heritage assets”.18

Text: Levels of significance Additionally, it is of course possible that sites, buildings or areas have no heritage significance.

Text: Assessment of harm Assessment of harm

Text: Assessment of harm Assessment of any harm will be articulated in terms of the policy and law that the proposed development will be assessed against, such as whether a proposed development preserves or enhances the character or appearance of a Conservation Area, and articulating the scale of any harm in order to inform a balanced judgement/weighing exercise as required by the NPPF.

Text: Assessment of harm In accordance with key policy, the following levels of harm may potentially be identified for designated heritage assets:

Text: Assessment of harm Substantial harm or total loss. It has been clarified in a High Court Judgement of 2013 that this would be harm that would ”have such a serious impact on the significance of the asset that its significance was either vitiated altogether or very much reduced”;19 and

Text: Assessment of harm Less than substantial harm. Harm of a lesser level than that defined above.

Text: Assessment of harm With regards to these two categories, the PPG states:

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 Hence, for example, harm that is less than substantial would be further described with reference to where it lies on that spectrum or scale of harm, for example low end, middle, and upper end of the less than substantial harm spectrum/scale.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 With regards to non-designated heritage assets, there is no basis in policy for describing harm to them as substantial or less than substantial, rather the NPPF requires that the scale of any harm or loss is articulated whilst having regard to the significance of the asset. Harm to such assets is therefore articulated as a level of harm to their overall significance, using descriptors such as minor, moderate and major harm.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 It is also possible that development proposals will cause no harm or preserve the significance of heritage assets. Here, a High Court Judgement of 2014 is relevant. This concluded that with regard to preserving the setting of a Listed building or preserving the character and appearance of a Conservation Area, "preserving" means doing "no harm".21

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 18 DLUHC, PPG, paragraph 039, reference ID: 18a-039-20190723.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 19 Bedford Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2013] EWHC 2847 (Admin), para. 25.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 20 DLUHC, PPG, paragraph 018, reference ID: 18a-018-20190723.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 21 R (Forge Field Society) v Sevenoaks District Council [2014] EWHC 1895 (Admin).

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 | P22-2067 | JT | August 2022 | 7 Cross Street, Altrincham

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 18

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 Preservation does not mean no change, it specifically means no harm. GPA:2 states that “Change to heritage assets is inevitable but it is only harmful when significance is damaged”.22 Thus, change is accepted in Historic England’s guidance as part of the evolution of the landscape and environment. It is whether such change is neutral, harmful or beneficial to the significance of an asset that matters.

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 As part of this, setting may be a key consideration. When evaluating any harm to significance through changes to setting, this Report follows the methodology given in GPA:3, described above. Fundamental to this methodology is a consideration of “what matters and why”.23 Of particular relevance is the checklist given on page 13 of GPA:3.24

Text: “Within each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.”20 It should be noted that this key document also states:

Text: “Setting is not itself a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation…”25 “Setting is not itself a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation…”25

Text: “Setting is not itself a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation…”25 Hence any impacts are described in terms of how they affect the significance of a heritage asset, and heritage interests that contribute to this significance, through changes to setting.

Text: “Setting is not itself a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation…”25 With regards to changes in setting, GPA:3 states that:

Text: “Conserving or enhancing heritage assets by taking their settings into account need not prevent change”.26 “Conserving or enhancing heritage assets by taking their settings into account need not prevent change”.26

Text: “Conserving or enhancing heritage assets by taking their settings into account need not prevent change”.26 Additionally, whilst the statutory duty requires that special regard should be paid to the desirability of not harming the setting of a Listed Building, that cannot mean that any harm, however minor, would necessarily require Planning Permission to be refused. This point has been clarified in the Court of Appeal.27

Text: Benefits Benefits

Text: Benefits Proposed development may also result in benefits to heritage assets, and these are articulated in terms of how they enhance the heritage interests, and hence the significance, of the assets concerned.

Text: Benefits As detailed further in Appendix 3, the NPPF (at Paragraphs 201 and 202) requires harm to a designated heritage asset to be weighed against the public benefits of the development proposals.28

Text: Benefits Recent High Court Decisions have confirmed that enhancement to the historic environment should be considered as a public benefit under the provisions of Paragraphs 201 to 203.29

Text: Benefits The PPG provides further clarity on what is meant by the term ‘public benefit’, including how these may be derived from enhancement to the historic environment (‘heritage benefits’), as follows:

Text: Benefits 19

Text: Benefits “Public benefits may follow from many developments and could be anything that delivers economic, social or environmental objectives as described in the National Planning Policy Framework (paragraph 8). Public benefits should flow from the proposed development. They should be of a nature or scale to be of benefit to the public at large and not just be a private benefit. However, benefits do not always have to be visible or accessible to the public in order to be genuine public benefits, for example, works to a listed private dwelling which secure its future as a designated heritage asset could be a public benefit.

Text: Examples of heritage benefits may include: ● sustaining or enhancing the significance of a heritage asset and the contribution of its setting

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework Appendix 2: Legislative Framework

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework Legislation relating to the built historic environment is primarily set out within the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, which provides statutory protection for Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas.31 It does not provide statutory protection for non-designated or Locally Listed heritage assets.

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework Section 66(1) of the Act goes on to state that:

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework “In considering whether to grant planning permission [or permission in principle] for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State, shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.”32

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework In the 2014 Court of Appeal judgement in relation to the Barnwell Manor case, Sullivan LJ held that:

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework “Parliament in enacting section 66(1) did intend that the desirability of preserving the settings of listed buildings should not simply be given careful consideration by the decision-maker for the purpose of deciding whether there would be some harm, but should be given “considerable importance and weight” when the decision-maker carries out the balancing exercise.”33

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework A judgement in the Court of Appeal (‘Mordue’) has clarified that, with regards to the setting of Listed Buildings, where the principles of the NPPF are applied (in particular paragraph 134 of the 2012 version of the NPPF, the requirements of which are now given in paragraph 202 of the current, revised NPPF, see Appendix 3), this is in keeping with the requirements of the 1990 Act.34

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework With regards to development within Conservation Areas, Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states:

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework “In the exercise, with respect to any buildings or other land in a conservation area, of any powers under any of the provisions mentioned in subsection (2), special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of that area.”35

Text: Appendix 2: Legislative Framework Unlike Section 66(1), Section 72(1) of the Act does not make reference to the setting of a Conservation Area. This makes it plain that it is the character and appearance of the designated Conservation Area that is the focus of special attention.

Text: Appendix 3: National Policy Guidance Appendix 3: National Policy Guidance

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021)

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) National policy and guidance is set out in the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) published in July 2021. This replaced and updated the previous NPPF 2019. The NPPF needs to be read as a whole and is intended to promote the concept of delivering sustainable development.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) The NPPF sets out the Government’s economic, environmental and social planning policies for England. Taken together, these policies articulate the Government’s vision of sustainable development, which should be interpreted and applied locally to meet local aspirations. The NPPF continues to recognise that the planning system is plan-led and that therefore Local Plans, incorporating Neighbourhood Plans, where relevant, are the starting point for the determination of any planning application, including those which relate to the historic environment.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) The overarching policy change applicable to the proposed development is the presumption in favour of sustainable development. This presumption in favour of sustainable development (the ‘presumption’) sets out the tone of the Government’s overall stance and operates with and through the other policies of the NPPF. Its purpose is to send a strong signal to all those involved in the planning process about the need to plan positively for appropriate new development; so that both plan-making and development management are proactive and driven by a search for opportunities to deliver sustainable development, rather than barriers. Conserving historic assets in a manner appropriate to their significance forms part of this drive towards sustainable development.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development and the NPPF sets out three ‘objectives’ to facilitate sustainable development: an economic objective, a social objective, and an environmental objective. The presumption is key to delivering these objectives, by creating a positive pro-development framework which is underpinned by the wider economic, environmental and social provisions of the NPPF. The presumption is set out in full at paragraph 11 of the NPPF and reads as follows:

Text: “Plans and decisions should apply a presumption in favour of sustainable development. “Plans and decisions should apply a presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Text: For plan-making this means that: For plan-making this means that:

Text: For plan-making this means that: a. all plans should promote a sustainable pattern of development that seeks to: meet the development needs of their area; align growth and infrastructure; improve the environment; mitigate climate change (including by making effective use of land in urban areas) and adapt to its effects;

Text: For plan-making this means that: b. strategic policies should, as a minimum, provide for objectively assessed needs for housing and other uses, as well as any needs that cannot be met within neighbouring areas, unless:

Text: For plan-making this means that: i. the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a strong reason for restricting the overall scale, type or distribution of development in the plan area; or

Text: For plan-making this means that: 23

Text: For plan-making this means that: ii. any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole.

Text: For decision-taking this means: For decision-taking this means:

Text: For decision-taking this means: a. approving development proposals that accord with an up-to-date development plan without delay; or

Text: For decision-taking this means: b. where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, granting permission unless:

Text: For decision-taking this means: i. the application policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or

Text: For decision-taking this means: ii. any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole.”37

Text: For decision-taking this means: However, it is important to note that footnote 7 of the NPPF applies in relation to the final bullet of paragraph 11. This provides a context for paragraph 11 and reads as follows:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “The policies referred to are those in this Framework (rather than those in development plans) relating to: habitats sites (and those sites listed in paragraph 180) and/or designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest; land designated as Green Belt, Local Green Space, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a National Park (or within the Broads Authority) or defined as Heritage Coast; irreplaceable habitats; designated heritage assets (and other heritage assets of archaeological interest referred to in footnote 68); and areas at risk of flooding or coastal change.”38 (our emphasis)

Text: For decision-taking this means: The NPPF continues to recognise that the planning system is plan-led and that therefore, Local Plans, incorporating Neighbourhood Plans, where relevant, are the starting point for the determination of any planning application.

Text: For decision-taking this means: Heritage Assets are defined in the NPPF as:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest. It includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local planning authority (including local listing).”39

Text: For decision-taking this means: The NPPF goes on to define a Designated Heritage Asset as a:

Text: For decision-taking this means: 24

Text: For decision-taking this means: “World Heritage Site, Scheduled Monument, Listed Building, Protected Wreck Site, Registered Park and Garden, Registered Battlefield or Conservation Area designated under relevant legislation.”40

Text: For decision-taking this means: As set out above, significance is also defined as:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting. For World Heritage Sites, the cultural value described within each site’s Statement of Outstanding Universal Value forms part of its significance.”41

Text: For decision-taking this means: Section 16 of the NPPF relates to ‘Conserving and enhancing the historic environment’ and states at paragraph 195 that:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal.”42

Text: For decision-taking this means: Paragraph 197 goes on to state that:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “In determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: For decision-taking this means: a. the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;

Text: For decision-taking this means: b. the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and

Text: For decision-taking this means: c. the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.”43

Text: For decision-taking this means: With regard to the impact of proposals on the significance of a heritage asset, paragraphs 199 and 200 are relevant and read as follows:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.”44

Text: For decision-taking this means: 40 DLUHC, NPPF, p. 66. 41 DLUHC, NPPF, pp. 71-72. 42 DLUHC, NPPF, para. 195. 43 DLUHC, NPPF, para. 197. 44 DLUHC, NPPF, para. 199.

Text: For decision-taking this means: | P22-2067 | JT | August 2022 | 7 Cross Street, Altrincham

Text: For decision-taking this means: 25

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification. Substantial harm to or loss of:

Text: For decision-taking this means: a. grade II listed buildings, or grade II registered parks or gardens, should be exceptional;

Text: For decision-taking this means: b. assets of the highest significance, notably scheduled monuments, protected wreck sites, registered battlefields, grade I and II* listed buildings, grade I and II* registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage Sites, should be wholly exceptional.”45

Text: For decision-taking this means: In the context of the above, it should be noted that paragraph 201 reads as follows:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent, unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following apply:

Text: For decision-taking this means: a. the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and

Text: For decision-taking this means: b. no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and

Text: For decision-taking this means: c. conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and

Text: For decision-taking this means: d. the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.”46

Text: For decision-taking this means: Paragraph 202 goes on to state:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.”47

Text: For decision-taking this means: The NPPF also provides specific guidance in relation to development within Conservation Areas, stating at paragraph 206 that:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas and World Heritage Sites, and within the setting of heritage assets, to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those

Text: For decision-taking this means: 26

Text: For decision-taking this means: elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.”48

Text: For decision-taking this means: Paragraph 207 goes on to recognise that “not all elements of a World Heritage Site or Conservation Area will necessarily contribute to its significance” and with regard to the potential harm from a proposed development states:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area or World Heritage Site should be treated either as substantial harm under paragraph 200 or less than substantial harm under paragraph 201, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area or World Heritage Site as a whole.”49 (our emphasis)

Text: For decision-taking this means: With regards to non-designated heritage assets, paragraph 203 of NPPF states that:

Text: For decision-taking this means: “The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.”50

Text: For decision-taking this means: Overall, the NPPF confirms that the primary objective of development management is to foster the delivery of sustainable development, not to hinder or prevent it. Local Planning Authorities should approach development management decisions positively, looking for solutions rather than problems so that applications can be approved wherever it is practical to do so. Additionally, securing the optimum viable use of sites and achieving public benefits are also key material considerations for application proposals.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance The then Department for Communities and Local Government (now the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC)) launched the planning practice guidance web-based resource in March 2014, accompanied by a ministerial statement which confirmed that a number of previous planning practice guidance documents were cancelled.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance This also introduced the national Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) which comprised a full and consolidated review of planning practice guidance documents to be read alongside the NPPF.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance The PPG has a discrete section on the subject of the Historic Environment, which confirms that the consideration of ‘significance’ in decision taking is important and states:

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance “Heritage assets may be affected by direct physical change or by change in their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent and importance of the

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance 27

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance significance of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, is very important to understanding the potential impact and acceptability of development proposals.”51

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance In terms of assessment of substantial harm, the PPG confirms that whether a proposal causes substantial harm will be a judgement for the individual decision taker having regard to the individual circumstances and the policy set out within the NPPF. It goes on to state:

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance “In general terms, substantial harm is a high test, so it may not arise in many cases. For example, in determining whether works to a listed building constitute substantial harm, an important consideration would be whether the adverse impact seriously affects a key element of its special architectural or historic interest. It is the degree of harm to the asset’s significance rather than the scale of the development that is to be assessed. The harm may arise from works to the asset or from development within its setting.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance While the impact of total destruction is obvious, partial destruction is likely to have a considerable impact but, depending on the circumstances, it may still be less than substantial harm or conceivably not harmful at all, for example, when removing later inappropriate additions to historic buildings which harm their significance. Similarly, works that are moderate or minor in scale are likely to cause less than substantial harm or no harm at all. However, even minor works have the potential to cause substantial harm.”52 (our emphasis)

Text: Appendix 4: Relevant Development Plan Policies Applications for Planning Permission within Altrincham are currently considered against the policy and guidance set out within the Trafford Local Plan Core Strategy (January 2012), the first of Trafford’s Local Development Framework (LDF) development plan documents to be adopted by Trafford Council and which partially supersedes the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan. Preparation of a new Trafford Local Plan is underway; however, at the time of writing, the draft of the new Local Plan is yet to be published.

Text: Appendix 4: Relevant Development Plan Policies The Trafford Local Plan Core Strategy contains one policy relating to the Historic Environment – Policy R1 – which states:

Text: “R1.1. All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness. “R1.1. All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.

Text: “R1.1. All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness. R1.2. Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas R1.3. Trafford’s Conservation Areas will be identified within the Land Allocations’ DPD. Within these areas the Council will:

Text: Conservation Areas • Carry out, and update where necessary, Conservation Area Appraisals, to inform the production of new and revised Supplementary Planning Documents;

Text: Conservation Areas • Develop Management Plans for existing Conservation Areas;

Text: Conservation Areas • Determine applications for demolition, taking account of the contribution made by the building or structure to the character, appearance or special architectural interest of the area as a whole, including the merits of any proposed (re)development. Where development is to follow demolition, it will be a requirement that detailed planning permission for the proposed redevelopment shall be obtained and the implementation of that proposal is secured before the existing building or structure is demolished; and

Text: Conservation Areas • Require developers to demonstrate how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the Conservation Area, and its wider setting in the light of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and area specific guidance notes.

Text: Conservation Areas R1.4. As appropriate, the Council will designate additional areas of the Borough for Conservation Area status through the Land Allocations DPD.

Text: Heritage Assets Heritage Assets

Text: Heritage Assets R1.5. In addition to preserving or enhancing Conservation Areas, the Council will identify, preserve, protect and enhance the positive features and characteristics of Trafford’s historic environment, through the Land Allocations DPD, the maintenance of the Historic Environment Record, the preparation of local lists, Supplementary Planning Documents and development briefs, as appropriate.

Text: Comment Details Comment Reasons:

Text: Comment Details Comment:Having digested the proposed ground floor plans I believe the ground floor serving hatch (on the cross street side) will provide congestion to the already congested cross street side of the building. That footpath is impassable during busy periods such as after school and weekends and adding queues of people along that stretch will further push pedestrians into the road area where, with the increase in delivery drivers (Deliveries/deliveroo/justeat) I have already witnessed countless incidents and near misses.

Text: Comment Details I have videos of that piece of footpath during such times and this clearly shows numbers of children spilling into the road as it is. This is without the addition of a queue of customers in their way.
