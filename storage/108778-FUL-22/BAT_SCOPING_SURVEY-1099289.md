Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: 1.1 Background 1.1 Background

Text: 1.1 Background Kingdom Ecology have carried out a Bat Scoping Survey of a series of commercial buildings located at 70-72 George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1RF (National Grid Reference SJ 76724 87798). Proposals are to remove existing structures and to erect two replacement buildings.

Text: 1.1 Background The latest field surveys were undertaken on the 20th June 2022. Surveys were carried out by Richard Roe (BSc, MSc, MIEEM, CEnv). Richard has extensive experience of undertaking bat surveys as a professional ecological consultant with over twenty years’ experience. Richard is also a licensed bat worker.

Text: 1.2 Purpose of Report 1.2 Purpose of Report

Text: 1.2 Purpose of Report This report provides and outlines the findings of field surveys undertaken at the site in June 2022.

Text: 1.2 Purpose of Report The field surveys examined habitats present with a focus on the existing buildings’ suitability to support roosting bats. Survey also examined the suitability of the site to support breeding birds. Survey comprised of a daytime assessment examining the interior and exterior of the buildings.

Text: 1.2 Purpose of Report Following a description of the survey findings and an evaluation of habitats at the site, the report goes on to make recommendations for further works, mitigation and ecological enhancement measures where relevant.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Taken together, this legislation makes it an offence to:

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Intentionally or deliberately kill, injure or capture bats.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report • Deliberately disturb bats, whether at roost or not.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report • Damage, destroy or obstruct access to bat roosts.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report • Possess or transport bats, unless acquired legally.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report • Sell, barter or exchange bats.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report A bat roost is interpreted as “any structure or place, which any wild bat uses for shelter or protection.” (Bat Conservation Trust 20161). A bat roost is protected whether or not bats are present at the time.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report All species of British bat are considered a European Protected Species (EPS). The Conservation of Habitat and Species Regulations (2010) provide derogation against certain offences which could potentially affect an EPS through the EPS Licensing system.

Text: 1.3.2 Birds 1.3.2 Birds

Text: 1.3.2 Birds All wild birds in England and Wales are protected under Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild bird, or take, damage or destroy the nest (whilst being built or in use) or its eggs.

Text: 2.1 Survey Aims and Objectives 2.1 Survey Aims and Objectives

Text: 2.1 Survey Aims and Objectives Survey comprised of a site visit and inspection of the affected buildings. The survey aim was to assess the site as to its suitability to support roosting bats and to identify suitable habitats for any other protected species including breeding birds.

Text: 2.1 Survey Aims and Objectives Survey also aimed to identify opportunities for ecological enhancement and to inform potential mitigation measures if required to ameliorate any negative impacts attributable to the proposed works.

Text: 2.2 Survey Methods 2.2 Survey Methods

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection The buildings were assessed as to their suitability to support bats following standard methodologies prescribed in English Nature’s Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell-Jones 2004)2 and the Bat Conservation Trust’s Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines 3rd Edition (BCT 2016)3.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection Survey, comprising of an inspection of the interior and exterior of the building, was undertaken during daylight conditions using binoculars, endoscope and a high-powered torch. The survey was undertaken during daylight hours on the 20th June 2022.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection In addition to searching for evidence of an actual bat roost the survey also aimed to assess the suitability of the building to support bats and consequently the likelihood of a bat roost being present but with no obvious field signs.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection Survey assessed each building’s roost suitability by examining structural features and the surrounding habitat. Structural features that will influence the suitability of a building to support roosting bats include the presence of a roof void; access points into a building including gaps beneath barge boards, gaps under lead flashing, gaps within masonry, loose tiles etc, complexity of any roof void, daytime light levels in roof void etc.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Important habitat features surrounding the structures which could influence roost potential include: whether the structure is in a semi- rural or parkland location, proximity to a significant linear feature (e.g. watercourse, mature hedgerow, wooded lane) or an area of woodland etc.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Taking account of these architectural and habitat features, each building was assigned a level of roost suitability based upon professional judgement.

Text: 3.1 Site Description 3.1 Site Description

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site comprises a group of buildings located at 70-72 George Street, Altrincham. The buildings extend back from George Street along an alleyway to Central Way and extend over an approximate 800 m² area.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The buildings comprise of two retail units, a bar/café and a gymnasium. The buildings comprise of a combination of flat-roofed and pitched roof structures arranged over one and two stories. The buildings are connected to one another and are constructed of brick. The buildings are considered likely to be mid-20th century origin.

Text: 3.1 Site Description An alleyway runs along the north-eastern edge of the buildings, whilst the Everyman Theatre building (which is a large, flat-roofed, brick built, modern structure) is located along the southwestern edge of the buildings. George Street is located to the southeast of the site, whilst Central Way is located to the northwest of the site.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site is located in the centre of the Altrincham town. Surrounding habitats are therefore highly modified and urbanised comprising principally of further retail units, paved areas and streets. There are no significant areas of park, woodland or other high quality bat foraging habitat located within proximity to the site.

Text: 3.1 Site Description Therefore, surrounding habitats are considered to offer ‘very low’ quality bat foraging habitat.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site’s location is shown in Figure 1 in the Appendix. The site layout is shown on Figure 2. Photographs of the site are also shown in the Appendix.

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey 3.2 Bat Survey

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey Surveyed buildings are numbered 1-3 and show Figure 2 in the Appendix.

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey Building 1 is located on Central Way. The ground floor of the building comprises of a café/bar. This part of the building is open at its west face and comprises of just steel girders, with no walls. The girders support the upper floor of the building which is brick built and has a shallow, pitched roof clad in tightly fitted mineral felt. Internally, the upper floor of the building comprises of a single open room which is used as a gymnasium. The upper floor room does not have a separate loft space, however there is a false ceiling constructed of polystyrene tiles.

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey 6

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report The upper floor room is brightly lit by windows and so both the ground floor and upper floor of the building are considered to be entirely unsuitable for bats. Externally, the building does not support any obvious suitable bat roosting features and was considered to be well sealed and intact.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Building 2 comprises of flat-roofed, two story buildings which are attached to Building 1 and form part of the gymnasium complex. These buildings are also constructed of brick and the roofs are clad in tightly fitted, mineral felt. The buildings have skylights and windows and so internally, are brightly lit. The buildings do not have separate roof void spaces. The buildings are well sealed offering no obvious bat roosting features or access to the building interior or the building’s wall structure.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Building 3 comprises of two adjacent retail units which face onto George Street. The ground floors of the units comprise of the store’s shopfronts, whilst the upper floors house the shop offices and storage areas. These buildings are also constructed of brick and the roofs are also clad in tightly fitted, mineral felt. The buildings do not have separate roof void spaces and the interiors are considered entirely unsuitable for roosting bats. The buildings are well sealed offering no obvious bat roosting features or access to the building interior or wall structure. These buildings are also considered to be negligible suitability for roosting bats.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report The buildings are all likely to be brightly lit from George Street and Central Way and to also suffer frequent human disturbance.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report No bat field signs were found at the site. No current or historic evidence of nesting bird activity was identified at site, and the buildings do not support any suitable bird nesting cavities.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Taking account of the buildings’ locations in a highly urbanised environment and the absence of any obvious potential bat roosting features, all buildings were assessed as offering a ‘negligible’ bat roosting potential.

Text: 4.1 Summary 4.1 Summary

Text: 4.1 Summary The daytime inspection did not identify any field signs indicative of roosting bats. Furthermore, the buildings at the site were found to be unsuitable for roosting bats as they are well sealed, offering no suitable roosting features and are located in a highly urbanised area. Therefore, the buildings were assessed as offering a ‘negligible’ bat roosting potential and it is considered to be very unlikely that the site would support any active bats roosts.

Text: 4.1 Summary No current or historic evidence of nesting bird activity was identified at site, and the buildings do not support any suitable bird nesting cavities.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements 4.2 Site Enhancements

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements Although the site is located within an urban area, it is recommended that that the development is enhanced to provide suitable nesting habitat for urban bird species.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements This can be achieved through the installation of swift and sparrow nest boxes into the proposed new buildings at the site.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The bird boxes can be built into the brick walls of the proposed buildings so as to remain visually unobtrusive.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The precise location, model and number of bird boxes should be determined by an appropriately qualified ecologist.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements It is also recommended that new landscaping is provided at the site including tree planting. Where possible this should comprise of native species can provide nectar sources for insects and berries/fruits for invertebrates and birds.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The following small/medium sized tree species are recommended as they offer suitable foraging opportunities to various native wildlife (including birds and invertebrates): rowan, wild cherry, crab apple, silver birch, holly, and willow.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements Any areas of new shrubbery should include suitable nectar sources for insects. The Royal Horticultural Society provides a list of suitable plants for invertebrates (see rhs.org.uk/plantsforpollinators). recommended that this list is consulted when producing any detailed landscaping designs for the site.
