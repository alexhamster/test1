Text: Heritage Assets Heritage Assets

Text: Heritage Assets • George Street Conservation Area

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment This Heritage Statement is submitted to support applications for Full Planning and Advertisement Consent on behalf of BT as part of the upgrade of their existing kiosk estate in Trafford. It should be read in conjunction with the Planning, Design and Access Statement submitted to the LPA.

Text: Impact Assessment In submitting these applications specific regard has been had to the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, (the Act) published Government guidance and the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Network Development. Special regard has also been given to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character, appearance and setting of nearby Conservation Areas and any other relevant historical assets in accordance with the Act. The adopted polices of the Trafford Local Plan have also been adhered to, SO8 - Protect the historic built environment.

Text: Impact Assessment The application site is located along a well-lit stretch of pavement on George Street, which is a busy public highway for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The area is predominantly made up of retail outlets at ground level including Holland & Barrett

Text: Impact Assessment TRA004-Planning-HeritageStatement

Text: Impact Assessment directly adjacent to the site. There is an array of established street furniture along this section of pavement including signposts, benches and bollards. It is also noted that other types of advertisements and fascia signs have been accepted in the vicinity, some of which are illuminated. These are located primarily at the ground level of nearby shops.

Text: Impact Assessment Whilst these modern, commercial surroundings are seen as an entirely appropriate location for a BT Street Hub unit, it is noted that the site is found within the George Street Conservation Area. Whilst the important scenic, historic and architectural features of this building and wider area are noted, it is argued that the primary setting of the application site outside Holland & Barret is one that is dominated by modern shop frontages and illuminated advertisements with fascial signage.

Text: Impact Assessment It needs to be reiterated that the development in question is for the upgrade of existing pieces of street furniture found. Given these telephone booths with their incorporated advertisements have already been accepted as part of this historical environment, the proposed BT Street Hub development will be able to effectively assimilate into a busy street scene where the precedent for modern communication infrastructure has already been set. As such due to the scale of development and wider setting of the locality, any impact by the proposal on the Conservation Areas is expected to be minimal.

Text: Impact Assessment Furthermore, it is considered that any minor to negligible harm that could be caused would be significantly outweighed by the removal of the two existing BT kiosks and the myriad of public benefits the Street Hub will bring to residents, businesses and tourists in this part of Altrincham. It is also believed that the decluttering of George Street pavement and upgrade of old street furniture will be to the betterment of the local Conservation areas and help to enhance the character of the area.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion It is widely recognised that street scenes up and down the country are constantly evolving, in which accommodating modern communication infrastructure is an essential part of this change. The proposed Street Hub is a slender, well-designed structure with

Text: Conclusion TRA004-Planning-HeritageStatement

Text: Conclusion advanced technology and public benefits that no other similar proposal can match. In this instance, when balanced against all material factors, the applicants conclude that the combination of the siting, design and public benefits provided will make the immediate area of Altrincham a more welcoming and accessible place to be, whilst at the same preserving the setting and significance of the Conservation Areas.

Text: TRA004 – Pavement o/s Holland & Barrett, 70 George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1RF We write on behalf of our client, BT, following our pre- application consultation relating to various sites, including the entitled, across your authority for the installation of BT Street Hubs and the associated removal of BT payphone kiosks. BT are moving forward with this case and are applying to Trafford Council for full planning permission and advertisement consent for installation of 1no. BT Street Hub and 2no. associated BT payphones.

Text: TRA004 – Pavement o/s Holland & Barrett, 70 George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1RF To recap, the InLink UK service was first launched in 2017 and since then 494 InLink structures were rolled out in 23 cities. These first-generation units offer 1Gbps free public Wi-Fi, free UK calls, USB charging, an emergency services button and a range of other digital services for those in the vicinity. HD displays on the sides are used to carry advertising, which helped to fund the units and its free services, but the screens can also show local content free of charge. The suppliers of InLinks unfortunately went into administration in 2019 and are no longer able to supply units to BT, hence this product is no longer available. Since then, BT have been working on a new and improved unit of their own, the BT Street Hub 2.0, that they are keen to rollout in your local authority area.

Text: BT Street Hub Project BT is continuing to move forward with public connectivity and benefits in which BT Street Hubs will provide a sleek and modern answer to the ever-increasing demands of a digitally connected society.

Text: BT Street Hub Project 1

Text: BT Street Hub Project BT Street Hubs have all the existing features of the previous InLink unit but has better Wi-Fi range and capabilities to include environmental sensors, insight counting and small cell mobile connectivity. The addition of the 5G small cells into BT Street Hubs is very much in line with current UK Government’s guidance on communications infrastructure and the National Infrastructure Strategy. This is echoed in the Government’s commitment towards telecommunications deployment which has been strengthened since the conception of InLinks as NPPF 2021, paragraph 114 confirms that; ‘Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being. Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G)’.

Text: BT Street Hub Project Since the rollout of InLinks, there has been increased focus on green initiatives and environmental monitoring. BT Street Hubs take this into account and have sensors that can count pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle movements as well as monitor air, sound and light. This free information has its own dashboard and will help the planning system actively manage patterns of growth in support of national air quality objectives and the Government’s ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. It can be a useful source of real-time data in the delivery of the Council’s own green agenda, travel plans and the data collected can help present a business case for carbon offset credit.

Text: BT Street Hub Project Overall, BT Street Hubs will help future proof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable, while also providing a valuable contribution to the Government’s aim to improve wireless communications across the UK. Investment in the high street is at an all-time low, but that has not slowed BT down as they look to ramp up their rollout of new BT Street Hubs across the UK. They are continuing their commitment to invest and improve in the high street, with one BT Street Hub at a time, and with that decluttering these environments with the associated removal of existing BT phone boxes.

Text: UK Digital Strategy Digital connectivity is now considered to be a utility, and modern life is increasingly impossible without it. Connectivity drives productivity and innovation and is the physical underpinning of a digital nation. Being connected is fundamental to the success in our modern forward-thinking streets and the proposed BT Street Hub provides a cost-free way for communities to get online and take advantage of available opportunities. The Government has committed that every individual and every business should have the skills and confidence to seize the opportunities of digital technology and have easy access to high-quality internet wherever they live, work, travel or learn. An update to the UK's Digital Strategy was published in June 2022 and reaffirms the continued promotion of the government’s policy of delivering improved digital infrastructure and connectivity.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 National Planning Policy Framework, 2021

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied and is a material consideration for both the Full Planning and Advertisement Consent applications.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 In the context of transport related matters as set out in Chapter 9 of NPPF, the following paragraphs are applicable to this BT Street Hub case:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 111 - Development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 112 - Within this context, applications for development should: [...] c) create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, avoid unnecessary street clutter, and respond to local character and design standards.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The NPPF supports the provision of high-quality communications infrastructure as set out in section 10. These relevant paragraphs are highlighted below:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 114 - Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being. Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections. Policies should set out how high-quality digital infrastructure, providing access to services from a range of providers, is expected to be delivered and upgraded over time; and should prioritise full fibre connections to existing and new developments (as these connections will, in almost all cases, provide the optimum solution).

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 115 - The number of radio and electronic communications masts, and the sites for such installations, should be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of consumers, the efficient operation of the network and providing reasonable capacity for future expansion. Use of existing masts, buildings and other structures for new electronic communications capability (including wireless) should be encouraged. Where new sites are required (such as for new 5G networks, or for connected transport and smart city applications), equipment should be sympathetically designed and camouflaged where appropriate.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 7

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 117 - Applications for electronic communications development (including applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 118 - Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The NPPF states the following specifically in relation to advertisement control in section 12:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 136 - The quality and character of places can suffer when advertisements are poorly sited and designed. A separate consent process within the planning system controls the display of advertisements, which should be operated in a way which is simple, efficient and effective. Advertisements should be subject to control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts.

Text: Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England

Text: Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England The Code of Best Practice has been fully revised, and the latest version was published by DCMS in March 2022. It acknowledges that the planning system plays a key role in delivering the digital infrastructure that we need, in a sustainable and well-designed way, especially as households and businesses become increasingly reliant on mobile connectivity. The principal aim of the Code is to ensure that the Government’s objective of supporting high quality communications infrastructure, which is vital to continued economic prosperity and social inclusion for all, is met. The Code confirms that the development of Wireless Network infrastructure must be achieved in a timely and efficient manner, in a way that balances connectivity requirements with the economic, community and social benefits that this brings with the environmental considerations associated with such development. BT Street Hub has a key role to play in delivering the necessary infrastructure to support the increasing reliance on mobile connectivity at a street level and so accords with the Code of Best Practice.

Text: Direct conversion Direct conversion

Text: Direct conversion In this instance the proposed BT Street Hub has been progressed as a direction conversion of an existing BT kiosk(s) as it is considered that its siting and appearance continues to fit into its immediate street scene context. It is felt that the BT Street Hub will be a clear improvement from the existing on-site arrangement.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Siting Justification against Planning Policy

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy At the conception stage, we have tried to focus on pursuing direct conversions of existing kiosks wherever practicable when considering the existing street scene layout and furniture. We have looked for locations with wide pavements, and where a site’s relationship with existing street furniture avoids an overwhelming proliferation of street clutter. It should be recognised that BT’s legacy estate of payphones has grown up organically over the years and the location of existing BT kiosks can sometimes sit in street scene environments that have changed completely since they were first established on-site. In some instances, the BT Street Hub project has been seen as an opportunity to improve the pedestrian environment by removing awkward BT kiosks and repositioning the new unit to a more in keeping spot in the street scene.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy It is appreciated that streets are ever-evolving environments, amidst society’s changing connectivity demands. BT has a license and universal service obligation with Ofcom to provide a street level phone service, so the selection process of associated kiosks to be removed has had to take this into account. The new unit provides for free telephone calls, has quick links to charity lines and an emergency 999 button, however, there is a recognition that the use of phone boxes has dramatically changed since kiosks were first conceived, whilst now the need for Wi-Fi and mobile coverage has increased massively. In this respect we have tried to build a sequence of BT Street Hub sites wherever possible, so that this can improve connectivity and the user experience as they travel through an area.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Likewise, as BT Street Hubs can provide the Council with valuable data as each unit has environmental sensors that can monitor air, sound and light, we have tried to plan a sequence of BT Street Hub sites wherever possible, along key routes, so that the information gathered can be better analysed. This free environmental data has its own Council dashboard and will help the planning system actively manage patterns of growth in support of national air quality objectives and will be a useful source of real-time data in the delivery of the Council’s own green agenda. In a similar vein, BT Street Hubs have the capability to monitor pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicle movements, hence in building a strategic

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy 12

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy network of BT Street Hub units it will help the Council to monitor and develop travel plans for the area.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy The introduction of any form of development within a particular environment will always be, to some degree, a noticeable addition or change to those residents, businesses and regular passers-by found closest. However, it should be appreciated that the visibility of something that is new or the change in form that has an established presence on-site, like a telephone kiosk to a BT Street Hub unit with digital advertisements, does not automatically result in an overwhelming adverse harm occurring. The starting point and fundamental principle applied by the applicant is always to replace existing BT phone boxes with BT Street Hub units where they will be in-keeping with their existing surroundings. In this regard it is seen as an opportunity to create an up-to-date network of sites and so help futureproof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy In progressing new BT Street Hub sites, so far as practicable we have sought to minimise the contrast between the development itself and its immediate environment through appropriate siting and design. The siting of each BT Street Hub has been considered having regard to the available footpath widths; the whereabouts of the existing payphones to be removed, and the visual character of the street scene. With regards its associated advertisement screens and as will be discussed later in this statement, careful consideration has been given to its siting whereby the immediate context and public highway safety issues have been taken on board. These criteria have been adjusted where necessary on a site-by-site basis to account for local context and policy requirements when assessing the site’s suitability to accommodate a new BT Street Hub unit.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Justification for the siting and appearance of the proposed BT Street Hub unit itself, has been assessed against up to date national and local planning policies and any other material considerations. Our assessment has concentrated on whether the removal of the existing BT call boxes when balanced against the replacement of new BT Street Hub with all its added features at the application site, creates a significant visual harm that would outweigh the public benefits.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy In this regard matters of siting, appearance and advertisements are discussed as follows: -

Text: Siting Siting

Text: Siting This proposal involves the removal of 2no BT existing call boxes in association with 1no proposed new BT Street Hub. At a strategic level the removal of these existing phone boxes will declutter street scenes throughout your authority and when comparing the footprint of existing call boxes to be removed and proposed BT Street Hub, it will free up more pedestrian space.

Text: Siting 13

Text: Siting centre. The Street Hub is proposed to be a direct replacement of an existing BT kiosk on a wide section of pavement which ensures that it’s siting here will not foster any unduly impacts on pedestrian amenity in this location. A BT Street Hub in this location would contribute to a network of proposed sites in Altrincham town centre.

Text: Siting This proposal has been progressed as the direct conversion of an existing back-to-back BT kiosk on George Street. George Street is a busy pedestrianised road and is one of the main high streets in Altrincham town centre with several national chains occupying this road. Given that the Street Hub is proposed to be positioned in the exact footprint of the existing BT kiosk, it is felt that it’s siting here would not foster any unduly effects on pedestrian amenity in this location. It is felt that the removal of the existing BT kiosks and their subsequent replacement with a modern BT Street Hub unit would enhance this modern part of Altrincham. A BT Street Hub in this location would contribute to a sequence of proposed sites along George Street and Altrincham town centre.

Text: Siting It is concluded that the siting of the proposed Street Hub is acceptable and is in accordance with the applicable national and local planning policies.

Text: Siting Appearance

Text: Siting The proposed BT Street Hub 2.0 unit is an advanced, modern development which has been designed following significant improvements in technology and digital content over recent years from when BTs first generation unit, InLink was rolled out. It can promote the image of the authority as a vibrant place, in which we believe it will improve the quality of the immediate streetscape for residents, businesses and visitors.

Text: Siting The proposed design is slimmer and takes a more compact profile than the existing BT payphone boxes that the proposed BT Street Hub is replacing. The user interface is located at a low level and is a similar height to an existing BT payphone unit to ensure that it is accessible to all users.

Text: Siting The appearance of the BT Street Hub unit has a vertical emphasis and by reason of its reduced footprint would give a slender, more elegant form of development when compared to an existing payphone kiosk. The appearance of the structure is not considered to be overly harmful to the wider street scene, especially when considering the nature of the existing payphones to be removed. Its height and dimensions are justified when considering the features, it incorporates such as small cell, in which we believe the appearance of the area will not be compromised by the proposed new BT Street Hub.

Text: Siting The new structure will be set within a generally commercial setting and busy stretch of road that is dominated by pedestrian movements; hence it is well-lit throughout the day. While it is accepted that

Text: Siting 14

Text: Siting the BT Street Hub advertisements will be more visible during the hours of darkness or in dull conditions, such matters can be controlled by condition and can be operated in accordance with levels of illumination as set out in the Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements' 2015. In this respect the digital screens will be operated within UK industry standards appropriate for the area and so their presence would not be appeared untoward with this stretch of road which is well lit by streetlights and window displays. In this context, the BT Street Hub design would not appear detrimental to the amenity of this locality, most notably the setting of the Conservation Area.

Text: Siting It is concluded that the dimensions and design of the proposed BT Street Hub are justified, and its appearance is an improvement when compared to the BT call boxes that are to be removed. Furthermore, the added features and communications facilities within the new unit are in full accordance with the Government’s digital policies and strategy which seek to promote improved connectivity. When balanced against such matters, it is considered that the appearance of the proposed BT Street Hub itself is acceptable and is in accordance with national and local planning policies.

Text: Pavement Width Pavement Width

Text: Pavement Width The total existing pavement width at this location is 10000mm. The total width of the BT Street Hub is 1236mm (tapering down to a footprint width of 1201mm on the pavement). With the BT Street Hub being located 500mm off the kerb, the remaining available footway allows for safe circulation space around the unit and will not restrict passing pedestrians’ movements. It is of note that the structure is only 350mm wide, so any minor narrowing of the footway occurs for just a few centimetres.

Text: Advertisements Advertisements

Text: Advertisements When seen in the overarching context of the street scene, it is considered that the location, size and height of the digital advertisement panels will, on balance, be acceptable. As previously discussed, it is believed that the siting and appearance of the BT Street Hub would not create significant harm to the amenity of the area that would outweigh the public benefits and other material factors of consideration.

Text: Advertisements In terms of public safety, the site of the BT Street Hub and the display of digital advertisements on its sides will allow for the continued safe movements of motorists and pedestrians. In this regard, its presence within the street scene would not endanger public safety of those people who are taking reasonable care for their own and others’ safety.

Text: Advertisements It is recognised that all advertisements are intended to attract people’s attention, however in this case their siting and size would not create an untoward feature within the street scene. The position

Text: Advertisements 15

Text: Advertisements where the BT Street Hub is to be located and the orientation of the advertisement screens in relation to the road would not cause unacceptable interference with nearby road signs and or navigational lights. Viewed within the street scene setting, the digital advertisements would be seen by passing pedestrians / motorists but would not create confusion nor influence the behaviour of drivers to such a degree that they would cause a hazard by reason of their presence. The proposed BT Street Hub would be sited away from road junctions so it would not unduly interrupt any visibility splays or sightlines. When viewed within the street scene context of the wider environment, it is considered that the BT Street Hub would not appear as an inappropriate feature to motorists.

Text: Advertisements With regards pedestrian safety, the BT Street Hub is positioned away from the road edge on a wide section of pavement without impeding pedestrian movements as ample footway width would be retained. Allowing for the orientation of the BT Street Hub’s user interface in relation to passing motorists, the public safety of those using it would not be put at risk as they would be set off the kerb edge.

Text: Advertisements The proposed usage for the screens has been set in line with Transport for London’s (TfL) policy document ‘Guidance for Digital Roadside Advertising and Proposed Best Practice – 2013’ [the TfL Guidance]. Each BT Street Hub location has been assessed against and would comply with the following additional criteria from the TfL Guidance.

Text: Advertisements • There would be no conflict with any traffic signs, signals, crossing points, schools, hospitals or low bridges.

Text: Advertisements • No sightlines or clearances would be affected.

Text: Advertisements • The TfL guidance states that ‘Static digital advertising is likely to be acceptable in locations where static advertising exists or would be accepted.’ There are existing traditional advertisement on similar sections of the respective roads in many cases.

Text: Advertisements • The geometry of the roads are not complicated and the driving conditions are not considered to be demanding or complicated.

Text: Advertisements • The advertisements would not be experienced by a driver in conjunction with any other similar digital advertisements.

Text: Advertisements • As per the TfL guidance, the advertisements would be located as close to the driver’s natural eye line as possible and facing as head-on to the traffic as is practical.

Text: Advertisements The lighting levels noted above are within the levels set for this type and size of screen (those under 10m2) as set by the Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements (2015). A copy of this document is appended for clarity.

Text: Advertisements It should be noted that the digital screens can be used by the Council as there is 5% free screen time allocated on each BT Street Hub unit. BT are also gifting free advertising space to nominated small businesses which is an added benefit to the local economy.

Text: Planning Conditions Planning Conditions

Text: Planning Conditions To give assurance that each Street Hub will operate as intended and the associated payphone removals will occur, we would be pleased to accept the following conditions or a mutually agreed version of them to be included as part of any planning consent:

Text: Planning Conditions A. Within three (3) months of development commencing the existing BT payphones shown above shall be removed in their entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land.

Text: Planning Conditions B. Pavement surrounding the Street Hub shall be made good to the same condition as the adjacent land.

Text: Planning Conditions C. The intensity of the illumination of the two digital display screens shall not exceed 600 candelas per square metre (cd/m2) between dusk and dawn, and 2,500 candelas per square metre (cd/m2) during the daytime, in line with the maximum permitted recommended luminance as set out by 'The Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements'.

Text: Planning Conditions D. The digital display screens shall not display any moving, or apparently moving, images (including animation, flashing, scrolling three dimensional, intermittent or video elements).

Text: Planning Conditions E. The minimum display time for each piece of content on the digital display screens shall be 10 seconds.

Text: Planning Conditions F. The interval between each piece of content on the digital display screens shall take place over a period no greater than one second; the complete screen shall change with no visual effects (including swiping or other animated transition methods) between displays and the display will include a mechanism to freeze the image in the event of a malfunction.

Text: Planning Conditions G. No content on the digital display screens shall resemble traffic signs, as defined in section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

Text: Planning Conditions H. This advertisement consent shall remain valid for a period of 10 years from the date of consent.

Text: Planning Conditions To justify condition Has suggested above it is recognised that advertisement consent usually lasts for 5 years, however a local planning authority has discretion on this matter and can grant consent for a longer or shorter period. Even where advertisement consent is only granted for a period of 5 years, the advert may continue to remain in place after that period without submitting any further application (under Class 14 deemed consent). After the expiry of the 5 years initial consent, the local planning authority has the power to issue a discontinuance notice on the advert if they feel that such action is necessary to remedy a substantial injury to the amenity of the locality.

Text: Planning Conditions Should your Council wish to append any other conditions to either the full planning or advertisement application, we would be most grateful if you could discuss these with us at your earliest opportunity during the determination process.

Text: Planning Conditions 17

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion BT Street Hubs have the potential to significantly enhance the provision of local community communications facilities and services. It is precisely the type of high-speed digital infrastructure that the Government is seeking to support as part of the presumption in favour of sustainable development. It will deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits by providing a suite of essential urban tools/services, including free ultrafast Wi-Fi to residents, businesses and visitors in this area. Overall BT Street Hubs will help future proof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable.

Text: Conclusion The proposed BT Street Hubs structures are of a high quality, accessible design that would be a significant improvement when compared to the existing BT payphones that are to be replaced. We consider the proposal in this case to be appropriately sited; to reduce street clutter, to improve available footway widths, not to negatively affect heritage assets nor adversely affect the visual amenity or public safety. We believe this statement has demonstrated that the BT Street Hub proposal is in accordance with national policy set out in the NPPF and local development plan policies, in which we would hope that this application can be supported by your Council.
