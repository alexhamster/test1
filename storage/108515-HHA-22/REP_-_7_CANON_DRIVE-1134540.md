Text: Comment Details Comment:The proposed extension as shown on the submitted, plan and elevation drawings ref. PP142 - 1/20, are acceptable.

Text: Comment Details My concern would be if, in the future, the Juliette balcony was to be exchanged for a railing around the perimeter of the flat roof thus allowing access to the flat roof. This would result in a loss of privacy to the rear of both 7 and 9 Canon Drive.

Text: Comment Details My observations are that the building work completed so far doesn't bare much resemblance to submitted plans. There is a door height opening been formed where the drawing shows a window and the wall has been rendered around the existing window, indicating an intention to retain this window. The new roof covering to the rear extension has been completed with only one of the three roof lights shown on the subtitled drawing, further reinforcing the prospect of the flat roof could be used as a balcony.
