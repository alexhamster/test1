Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.1

Text: 1.0 Introduction This statement is to support the application for planning permission for a two-storey side extension to the existing garage at 4 Harrington Road, Altrincham.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.2

Text: 1.0 Introduction In this statement we discuss the site, surroundings and planning history. We then provide details of the proposal, set out how the proposed development complies with the relevant national and local planning policies and consider the heritage issues.

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings 2.0 Site and surroundings

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings 2.1 The site is located on the northern side of Harrington Road in Altrincham. It is occupied by a modern two-storey detached dwelling. The property is constructed mainly using facing red brickwork, with rendered and timber elements at first floor level. It has a slate tiled gabled and hipped roof designs with a front gabled dormer.

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings 2.2

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings The site is surrounded by large detached residential properties. It is accessed from Harrington Road.

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings 2.3 The application site is located in Devisdale Conservation Area. Immediately to the south-west of the site, on the opposite side of Harrington Road is a Grade II listed group of houses; Suffolk House, Bradgate and Holmacre.

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings 2.4

Text: 2.0 Site and surroundings The site is not within any flood risk area and there are no TPOs within or adjacent to the site.

Text: 3.0 Planning history 3.0 Planning history

Text: 3.0 Planning history 3.1 The Trafford planning applications website shows two previous applications on the site, which were both approved:

Text: 3.0 Planning history • 90751/HHA/17 - Erection of two storey side and rear extensions, a single storey rear extension, erection of a new front dormer window and conversion of the garage and loft space into habitable living accommodation.

Text: 3.0 Planning history • 99577/HHA/19 - Erection of single storey rear extension.

Text: 3.0 Planning history The first application was not implemented.

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.0 Proposal

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.1 The house currently has an attached garage on the eastern side, with a snug above it at first floor level. The proposal is for a two-storey side extension in front of this. The

Text: 4.0 Proposal building line at the side of the extension will match the existing building line at the side of the garage. The building line at the front will be set back from the main property.

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.2 The extension will join up with the existing garage/snug to create a private amenity space for a gym, allow garage parking space for 2 cars and provide habitable living accommodation on the first floor.

Text: 4.0 Proposal The front and rear elevations will have dark grey timber windows, with black gutters and downpipes to replicate the existing house. The existing dark grey metal garage doors will be replicated in a relocated position at the front of the extension. There will be a black-painted timber fascia. The eastern elevation will have brickwork matching the existing house. The rear will have dark grey aluminium New Wave style doors.

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.3

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.4 The roof will be a crown roof with a roof window on the flat top section. The roof tiles will be dark grey to match the existing house.

Text: 4.0 Proposal No changes are proposed to access or parking.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.0 National planning policy

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.1

Text: 5.0 National planning policy The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2021) is a material consideration in any development proposals. The principle thread running through the NPPF is the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Para. 11 states that proposals which accord with the development plan should be approved.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.2 Para. 130 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments meet certain requirements, including that they:

Text: 5.0 National planning policy a) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;

Text: 5.0 National planning policy b) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;

Text: 5.0 National planning policy c) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.3 The proposal meets these requirements because it will function well, improving amenity at the property. It has been well designed and will be visually attractive, and materials will match the existing property.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.4 Para. 130 goes on to state that developments should provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. The proposal will improve amenity for the

Text: 5.0 National planning policy occupiers. There will not be any adverse impact on the amenity of neighbours, due to the appropriate scale of the proposed building.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.5 With regard to heritage assets, the NPPF states the following (para. 195):

Text: 5.0 National planning policy “Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal.”

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.6

Text: 5.0 National planning policy Para. 201 states that proposals that will result in loss of or substantial harm to a heritage asset should not usually be permitted. Para. 202 states that:

Text: 5.0 National planning policy “Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.”

Text: 5.0 National planning policy The proposed works comply with the NPPF because the heritage assets (the conservation area and nearby listed group of buildings) will not be harmed. This is discussed in the next section.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.7

Text: 6.0 Local planning policy 6.0 Local planning policy

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Trafford Core Strategy (2012)

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Policy L7 of the Core Strategy states that with regard to design, development must:

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Be appropriate in its context

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Make best use of opportunities to improve the character and quality of an area

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Enhance the street scene or character of the area by appropriately addressing scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevation treatment, materials, hard and soft landscaping works, boundary treatment;

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Policy R1 of the Core Strategy requires all new development to take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness. Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.2

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.3 The proposal accords with these policies; it is a proposal for a modest extension, which will be built using materials to match the existing house. It will not impact on- street parking levels.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.4 Policy L7 of the Core Strategy states that development must not prejudice the amenity of future occupiers of the development and/or occupants of adjacent properties by reason of overbearing, overshadowing, overlooking, visual intrusion, noise or disturbance, odour or in any other way.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.5 The proposal accords with this policy because it will improve amenity at the property for the occupiers. It will not impact adjacent properties as it will be well screened by landscaping, and it is for private use.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016)

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) 6.6 The building is not identified as a "positive contributor" to the Conservation Area. The following policies are of relevance:

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 14

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) If the replacement of doors or windows is proposed, whether the existing is of timber or uPVC, any further replacements should be in timber and should represent a significant improvement over the existing. Where windows are replaced, they should respect the size and form of the original opening(s) and glazing bars, and be of an appropriate traditional design. Replacement doors and windows should not detract from the established character of the building.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 16

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Roof lights should not to be installed in locations that impact on the aesthetic value of the principal elevation or streetscape and should not be disproportionately large compared to the established fenestration. Conservation roof lights should be installed rather than standard roof lights.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 18

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Established architectural detailing and features are not to be removed or replaced, unless on a like-for-like basis. All replacement features should conform to the original design of the property, as described in the design guidance above.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 49

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Any new development should be of high quality and should take inspiration from the established architectural styles within the Conservation Area.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 50

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Extension of an existing building should have regard to its established style by echoing the building’s established features, form, proportions and materials.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 51

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) The scale of any new development should mirror the existing building and plot sizes.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) The proposal is in accordance with all these requirements.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.0 Heritage Assessment

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.1 The property is located within the Devisdale Conservation Area and is close to the Grade II listed group of houses; Suffolk House, Bradgate and Holmacre. Both the conservation area and the listed buildings are heritage assets.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.2 In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2021) we are required to describe the significance of the heritage assets.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.3

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment To assess significance, the guidance provided in Historic England’s Good Practice Advice in Planning 2 (Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment) has been followed.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.4

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment The Devisdale Conservation Area Appraisal identifies that the application site is within the Character Zone A: Northern Residential. This character zone is comprised of residential properties from the Victorian, Edwardian post war and mid-20th to early 21st centuries. There are a variety of architectural styles, scale, massing and plot sizes throughout the area. The character of this zone is one of an affluent residential suburb. Some areas feel more secluded than others due to the properties being set back from the street, but the prevalence of low stone walls with mature planting above unifies the entire zone.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.5 The significance of the heritage asset therefore comes from its architecture and layout.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.6

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment The Grade II listed group of houses - Suffolk House, Bradgate, Holmacre - is located on the opposite side of Harrington Road. They were first listed in July 1985. The list entry (1067963) describes them as follows:

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment “Includes Holmacre and Bradgate, Harrington Road. House, now three houses. c.1860. Yellow and pink brick used to give polychromatic effect; slate roof. Large 2- storey house (plus basement and attic) in an Italianate style which has a slightly later wing to the east and some C20 alterations both of which are in keeping. 6-bay house with 3-bay addition. Projecting brick plinth, stone bands, striated patterned and zig- zag brickwork, timber bracketed eaves, hipped roofs and several decorative chimney stacks. 2-storey canted bay window in bays 1 to 3. Elaborate timber porch to bay 5. Bays 5 and 6 are set back but given emphasis by a tall mansard roof with dormer window. All windows are sashes with either semicircular, segmental or flat arched heads in coloured brick. The jambs use ovolo-moulded bricks and in some cases form pilasters with moulded stone capitals. Several first floor windows have small stone

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment balconies with cast iron railings. Left elevation has small central pediment; the rear, a 3-arch recessed loggia (now door to Holmacre) and a projecting bay, canted at first floor level.”

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.7 The significance of the group of listed buildings therefore derives from design and detailing.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.8 The proposal will not cause any harm to the heritage assets. The proposed extension will match the main house in style and materials. It will be lower than the main part of the house and will be set back from the front building line.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.0 Summary

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.1 The site is located on the northern side of Harrington Road in Altrincham. It is occupied by a modern two-storey detached dwelling and is surrounded by similar low density residential development.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.2 The site is located in the Devisdale Conservation Area and immediately to the south- west of the site, on the opposite side of Harrington Road is a Grade II listed group of houses; Suffolk House, Bradgate and Holmacre.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.3 The proposal is for a two-storey side extension. It will match the main house in style and materials. It will be lower than the main part of the house and will be set back from the front building line.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.4 The extension will improve amenity at the property. There will be no adverse impacts on neighbours due to the sensitive design of the proposal.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.5 The proposal will not cause any harm to either the conservation area or the setting of the listed buildings.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.6 The proposal complies with national and local planning policy and should therefore be approved.

Text: 1.1. Purpose of the report The report is written by Stewart Bradshaw for Jamie Kordecki. Stewart carried out a Preliminary Roost Assessment of 4 Harrington Road, Bowdon, on 27th July 2022.

Text: 1.2. Survey aims 1.2. Survey aims

Text: 1.2. Survey aims The aim of the survey was to determine the actual or potential presence of bats and the need for further survey or mitigation.

Text: 1.3. Surveyor details 1.3. Surveyor details

Text: 1.3. Surveyor details Stewart is licensed to disturb, take and handle all species of bats in all counties of England under licence number 2015-15615-CLS-CLS. He has more than 10 years of experience in ecological consultancy, including the planning & preparation of bat surveys, and mitigation licences.

Text: 1.4. Reason for survey 1.4. Reason for survey

Text: 1.4. Reason for survey The development proposals are for a full height side extension of the property including changes to the roof, and changes to the internal layout.

Text: 1.5. Site context 1.5. Site context

Text: 1.5. Site context The house is located on Harrington Road, Bowdon, WA14 4QY, GR SJ 75831 88107, approximately 1.5km west of Altrincham Town Centre. The house is in a residential area surrounded by large suburban houses and mature gardens with trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site includes an occupied detached house, with an attached garage, gardens to the front and rear, and areas of hard landscaping.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 50m of the house includes; houses, gardens, mature trees, small areas of open green-space, and busy well-lit roads.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 500m includes, housing and busy roads, linked back gardens, areas of open green-space, hedgerows, watercourses, and mature trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context Areas of open green space locally, and linked back gardens, potentially provide foraging opportunities for bats. However, the area in general is fragmented by busy well-lit roads, noise, trafﬁc, and other human activity.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site and surrounding area provide low quality foraging, commuting, and roosting opportunities for bats, with higher quality habitat to the southwest around Dunham Massey.

Text: 2.2. Desk study The development has a small footprint, and impacts beyond the site boundary are unlikely. A site-speciﬁc investigation was considered more suitable.

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment 2.3. Habitat assessment

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment The habitat on site and in the surrounding area was assessed using Ordinance Survey mapping, and aerial photography. Habitat features on site, and those in the surrounding area were assessed for their suitability for use by bats during the site visit.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection 2.4. Building inspection

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the exterior of the building was made to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate any evidence of bats such as live or dead specimens, bat droppings, urine splashes, fur-oil staining and or squeaking noises. Bat specimens and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence; the other types are not always the result of bat activity. Sometimes bats leave no visible sign of their presence on the outside of a building (even when they do wet weather can wash evidence away.)

Text: 2.4. Building inspection The search included (where present) the ground beneath potential access points, windowsills, window panes, walls, behind peeling paintwork and lifted rendering, hanging tiles, weatherboarding, eaves, sofﬁt boxes, fascia’s, lead ﬂashing, gaps under felt, under tiles / slates and in existing bats boxes. Gaps in brickwork and stonework were searched (where present). All evidence of use by bats, or features with the potential to be used by bats was recorded and photographed.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the inside of the building was undertaken to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate evidence of bats. Bat specimens (live or dead) and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence. Other evidence can include urine splashes, fur-oil staining, feeding remains, squeaking noises, bat ﬂy (Nycteribiid) pupal cases (Hutson 1984) or odour.

Text: 3. Results 3.1a – The front of the house.

Text: 3. Results No4 Harrington Road, Bowdon, is a modern detached house, which is currently occupied. It has a pitched roof, covered with slate roof tiles, and ceramic ridge tiles. A ground ﬂoor extension to the rear has a ﬂat roof covered with a modern rooﬁng membrane.

Text: 3. Results Roof pitches face north, south, east, and west; gables face north & south. Lead ﬂashing is ﬁtted at the base of chimneys, around dormers, and where roof tiles abut brickwork. UPVC fascia boards are ﬁtted at the eaves.

Text: 3. Results Walls are brick with an insulating cavity, discreet steel lintels are ﬁtted, sills are UPVC; window and door frames are UPVC, all glass is intact.

Text: 3. Results The building was extended and refurbished in 2017, it was built to a high standard, is well maintained, and in good condition. Ridge tiles are ﬁxed tightly, there are no damaged or missing ridge tiles. There are no damaged, slipped, or missing roof tiles. Roof tiles are tightly ﬁtted, with no gaps between tiles. UPVC fascia boards are ﬁtted to the end of rafters and purlins with a wide gap between boards and brickwork. Gaps between boards and brickwork at the eaves are ﬁlled with sealant. Walls are in good condition, with no missing mortar or cracks.

Text: 3. Results There are no features externally which are likely be used by roosting bats, and no indications of use by bats were present during the inspection.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2. Internal inspection

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2a – The roof void.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The house has a single roof void, which is not used for storage, and is accessed infrequently for essential maintenance.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The roof has a trussed timber structure, lined with a modern breathable membrane, and insulated with mineral wool between the ceiling joists. The roof lining is in good condition with no tears, or gaps.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The wall cavity has been ﬁlled with insulation and was inspected at the wall plate using an endoscope. There are no gaps at the wall-plate; and there are no gaps which give direct access to the roof void from the outside. Boxed sofﬁts open into the roof void and were inspected from above.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The house has no cellar, and there are no other enclosed spaces which are suitable to be used by roosting bats.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.3. Indications of use

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection No indications of use by bats were present during the survey, either internally, or externally.

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability 3.4. Level of suitability

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability The house has negligible suitability for use by roosting bats. This is as the building is well maintained, in good condition, and as no suitable roosting opportunities were noted during the building inspection.

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability Preliminary Roost Assessment | 4 Harrington Road - Bowdon | 28th July 2022

Text: 4. Evaluation 4. Evaluation

Text: 4. Evaluation The building is set in an area which, in general, provides low quality habitat, for foraging, commuting and roosting bats, although bats are likely to be present locally.

Text: 4. Evaluation Areas of open green space, and linked back gardens locally provide limited foraging opportunities for bats, in an area which is fragmented by light and noise disturbance.

Text: 4. Evaluation Houses immediately adjacent to good quality habitat are more likely to be used by roosting bats than those further away. However, the house is well-sealed, and has no features which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The area in general is fragmented by well-lit roads, trafﬁc, noise, and other human activity. Fragmentation is likely to reduce the number of species present locally, and the number of individual bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The house was recently extended and refurbished, is well maintained, and in good condition. There are no features externally, which are suitable, or likely to be used by roosting bats; the roof void has no gaps which could give direct access to roosting bats, and no evidence of use was found during the inspection.

Text: 4. Evaluation The lack of any indications of use inside the roof void, such as bat droppings or feeding remains, reduces the likelihood of a signiﬁcant roost being present. If bats were present inside the roof void, even in lower numbers, some evidence of use would be likely to persist.

Text: 4. Evaluation Roof and ridge tiles are in good condition, ridge tiles are sealed with cement. There are no gaps between rooﬁng materials which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The walls are brick with an insulating cavity. The wall cavity has been ﬁlled with insulation. Walls are in good condition, with no cracks, or missing mortar which could be used by crevice dwelling bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Window and door frames are ﬁxed into the brickwork, gaps are ﬁlled with sealant, and offer no suitable roosting opportunities.

Text: 4. Evaluation UPVC fascia boards at the eaves are ﬁxed to the ends of rafters & purlins with a wide gap between boards & brickwork, and do not offer suitable roosting opportunities for bats. Wall cavities open into the roof void, and were inspected from above.

Text: 4. Evaluation The small gaps between brickwork, roof timbers, and rooﬁng materials, in the roof void were inspected in detail using an endoscope. No droppings were found, and no suitable gaps were present which could give access, or shelter to roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Taking into account the habitat surrounding the site, and the features present, the building is unlikely to be used by roosting bats and has negligible suitability for use.

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 4.1. Legal and planning context
