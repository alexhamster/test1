Text: Table of Contents 1. Summary.

Text: Table of Contents (This summary should be read in conjunction with the conclusions and recommendations.)

Text: Table of Contents This detached house is in a sub-urban area, close to the Bridgewater Canal.

Text: Table of Contents A few bat droppings were found at the western gable end of the loft and an access gap was identified at the external gable apex. Two droppings were collected to allow them to be sent for dna analysis if necessary, but they appeared typical of the pipistrelle bat (common or soprano).

Text: Table of Contents There was easy access for bats over the internal gable wall so the small number of droppings found suggested this probably is not a maternity colony roost. Bat activity survey work spaced over the season when bats are active would be needed to add substance to this supposition.

Text: Table of Contents I understand a single-storey extension may be added to the western elevation; otherwise work involves loft conversion with possible two-storey rear extension. I believe it is not planned to re-roof. The client is of the opinion that the proposed works will not impact the bat roost directly. If the roost will be impacted directly, a licence from Natural England is necessary to allow the work to proceed within the law.

Text: Table of Contents In order to obtain a licence the need to impact a bat roost has to be justified and if it's possible to do the work without impacting the bat roost, Natural England would expect that option to be selected.

Text: Table of Contents Whether or not further survey work is needed to allow a licence from Natural England to be obtained; hinges on whether the roosting area will be directly impacted by the work. If the roof and boxed eaves within around 1m of the west-facing gable apex will remain completely untouched, the work can be done without a licence, with a reasonable degree of confidence that the roost/bats will be unaffected.

Text: Table of Contents The number of droppings found does not suggest use by a maternity colony of bat with dependent young in summer, but as bat activity survey work has not been done to investigate the status of the roost, the development must be timed to avoid the main maternity colony period of May to August inclusive.

Text: Table of Contents Whether or not the roost area will be directly impacted needs to be confirmed by the client with both the architect and the contractors. The preferred option is a meeting involving all relevant parties, including the bat consultant, to discuss the work and whether it can definitely be done without impacting the roost.

Text: Table of Contents If there is any doubt at all whether this can be ensured, further bat activity survey work is needed to facilitate obtaining an appropriate licence from Natural England.

Text: Table of Contents If the work goes ahead without a licence and the roost is actually impacted after all, a prosecutable offence will have taken place. It's vital therefore that it is not simply assumed by the client that the work will not impact that part of the roof directly. Essentially a precautionary "no-go" area exists for a metre in all directions from the gable apex, as it is unknown whether bats may roost between tiles and underfelt, or in other parts of the cavity wall.

Text: Table of Contents Angela Graham Bat Consultancy Service Ltd: 07710 184142, bat.consultancy@talktalk.net 3

Text: Table of Contents Otherwise a licence is needed to cover the possible interference with a bat roost/roosting bats. In order to obtain the licence at least two, probably three, bat activity surveys would be needed, spaced over the season when bats are active.

Text: Table of Contents To ensure contractors appreciate the situation fully, the bat consultant needs to give a tool-box-talk before they start work and attend site during any work involving opening-up the roof. Please note the existing boxed eaves cannot be removed without a licence.

Text: Table of Contents There is bat access available behind hanging-tiles to the front (south-facing) elevation, including at the gable apex. It has been assumed that this gable will be unaffected by the work. If this is not the case, the internal front gable wall needs to be inspected. It was omitted at this survey due to the presence of wasps.

Text: Table of Contents Care should be taken when planning any lighting on the site, to ensure the roost is unaffected.

Text: 2. Introduction 2. Introduction

Text: 2. Introduction I was asked to assess the importance of this property to bats as part of the planning process, prior to loft conversion and extension works. Incidentally I comment on any issues discovered with respect to other protected/priority/invasive species and species of conservation concern.

Text: 2. Introduction This is a small, detached house, about 30 years old:

Text: 2. Introduction Front (south) and rear elevations

Text: 2. Introduction It is in a sub-urban location of similar properties on a large estate, but is only about 60m from the Bridgewater Canal to the north:

Text: 2. Introduction Angela Graham Bat Consultancy Service Ltd: 07710 184142, bat.consultancy@talktalk.net 4

Text: 2. Introduction Location of property indicated by red circle

Text: 2. Introduction John Leigh Park is about 650m away to the south-east and the Dunham Golf and Country Club grounds are a similar distance away to the south-west, with Dunham Park beyond, where at least 8 species of bat have been recorded.

Text: 2. Introduction The pipistrelle bat (2 species: Pipistrellus pipistrellus - the common pipistrelle, and Pipistrellus pygmaeus - the soprano pipistrelle) is common and widespread in the area.

Text: 2. Introduction Roosts of these species can occur in any building that provides suitable roosting crevices, with the risk of bat presence increased by close proximity to good bat feeding habitat and commuting routes; for example tree-lines, hedges, woodland, scrub and water courses and bodies. The bats use different roosts at different times of year, sometimes singly and sometimes in large groups of females with dependent young. They can move frequently and unpredictably between the roost sites known to them. The majority of house-holders with a roost of this species are unaware of it.

Text: 2. Introduction In summer females gather together each with their single off-spring in, sometimes large, maternity colony groups. Disturbance can cause the abandonment of babies (pups). In autumn when the young are independent, females visit males to mate. In winter the bats hibernate and rousing from hibernation - a slow process - can result in a depletion of fat reserves that may compromise the bats' ability to survive the winter. Females become pregnant in spring when their food (insects) becomes available again.

Text: 2. Introduction Pipistrelle bats in particular are extremely small, weighing about 5g (the weight of a 2p coin) so need only the smallest of gaps in order to enter to roost; often making use of external features and wall cavities without leaving signs in the loft/interior.

Text: 2. Introduction Angela Graham Bat Consultancy Service Ltd: 07710 184142, bat.consultancy@talktalk.net 5

Text: 2. Introduction A data search from the National Biodiversity Network discovered records of common pipistrelle bat within 500m. Extending the search to 2kms only added noctule (Nyctalus noctula). Extending it to 5kms however added 9 additional species.

Text: 2. Introduction A search of DEFRA's Magic database discovered that 5 bat European Protected Species licences had been granted for developments within 2 kilometres. Two were just over 500m away - one for common pipistrelle and one for soprano pipistrelle. All others were for common pipistrelle.

Text: 2. Introduction Other species that will inevitably occur within 1 or 2 kilometres include the Daubenton's (Myotis daubentonii), brown long-eared (Plecotus auritus) and the whiskered (Myotis mystacinus)/Brandt's (Myotis brandtii), which are hard to separate without dna analysis.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law 3. Bats and the Law

Text: 3. Bats and the Law All British bats and their roosts are legally protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 (as amended) and the EC Habitats Directive of 1994 as implemented by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Where a development will destroy a bat roost, a Low Impact Class Licence or a European Protected Species Licence (Mitigation Licence) is required before the roost can be interfered with in any way. The former applies in cases where only small numbers of common species of bat are using the building within certain parameters. It usually takes approximately 2 weeks for these licences to be issued, whereas the turn-around time for a full European Protected Species Licence is approximately 7 weeks once the application has been submitted. Any licence issued is a legally binding document.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Licences can only be issued providing planning permission has been granted, where applicable.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law When a roost is found, both the bat consultant and the planners have to apply the "three tests" required by Natural England. Essentially these are:

Text: 3. Bats and the Law That the development is necessary for the purpose of “preserving public health or public safety or other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature and beneficial consequence of primary importance for the environment”;

Text: 3. Bats and the Law That there is “no satisfactory alternative”;

Text: 3. Bats and the Law That the action authorised “will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range”.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law N.b. The way in which the necessity is assessed includes whether the client has an alternative that it would be reasonable to expect them to adopt.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Necessary mitigation and compensation measures to ensure the favourable conservation status of bats will be maintained, would include appropriate timing and methodology for the work, including details of how the bats will be provided-for in the long term.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Planners are required by the Government to satisfy themselves before granting planning consent that it would be possible for a licence to be obtained if necessary. Accordingly they are obliged to apply the three tests before issuing consent. For this reason enough survey work has to have been undertaken that the planning authority can evaluate whether or not the three tests can be satisfied and

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Angela Graham Bat Consultancy Service Ltd: 07710 184142, bat.consultancy@talktalk.net 6

Text: 3. Bats and the Law what degree of compensation/enhancement is necessary. To avoid delays in obtaining consent it is in the client's best interest to find out sooner rather than later whether any bat roosting issues need to be addressed.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Natural England, the Government body responsible for administering the law relating to bats, have issued guidelines to planners on how to proceed with respect to bats

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Outside the planning system, the onus is on developers/members of the public, to have sufficient investigations undertaken to satisfy themselves (and the authorities in the event of a subsequent investigation), that their actions are unlikely to be in contravention of bat legislation.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law N.b. It should always be remembered that bats often roost in places not anticipated by a lay person, such as modern buildings, trees with cavities, and bridges. Some leave no signs in lofts, as they roost underneath external features such as roof slates, ridges, weather-boarding and cladding.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law In the case of a building, tree or other feature not already known to be a bat roost, if bats are found during the course of work, contractors are legally obliged to stop work and seek advice. This should be from an appropriately experienced and licenced bat ecologist.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Additional Relevant Legislation and Policy.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Between 1995 and 2010 certain more vulnerable habitats and species were the subject of National or Local Biodiversity Action Plans. This strategy for the protection of biodiversity has been superseded by UK post-2010 Biodiveristy Framework, which is largely now implemented at county level. Internationally The Convention on Biodiversity produced a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. Further to this the EU Biodiversity Strategy was launched in 2011.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 lists species “of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The list was up-dated in 2014 and includes the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), noctule (Nyctalus noctula) soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) and 4 other bat species.

Text: 3. Bats and the Law The National Planning Policy Framework of 2012 (2) states that "the planning system should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment" by a number of means, including "minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in biodiversity where possible, contributing to the Government’s commitment to halt the overall decline in biodiversity, including by establishing coherent ecological networks… . "

Text: 4. Survey 4. Survey

Text: 4. Survey I made a daytime visit on 2/8/22 to undertake a preliminary survey of the building, assess its likely importance to bats and advise whether or not a precautionary approach or further survey work is needed.

Text: 4. Survey Having been involved with bat survey work for 35 years and consultancy work for 26 years, it is always my objective to carry-out my work in a manner consistent with accepted Good Practice Guidelines (2) and consistent with the code of practice of the CIEEM. I hold Natural England Class Licences CL21 (Annex B) and 18. Amongst other things these cover me to apply for Low Impact Licences for clients and undertake bat survey work. I also have a CL29 Barn Owl Class Licence. My credentials are expanded- upon in Appendix 1.

Text: 4. Survey Angela Graham Bat Consultancy Service Ltd: 07710 184142, bat.consultancy@talktalk.net 7

Text: 4. Survey As far as possible, I surveyed the building inside and out with the aid of surveyor's ladders, 2 million candle-power torch, camera with 6x optical zoom and binoculars (8x42). Head-torch, 10x 50 binoculars, fibrescope (6 and 13mm heads, extendable to 2m), camera with 18x zoom and mirrors were also available if needed.

Text: 4. Survey I was looking for access to potential roosting places and evidence of their use, such as droppings and staining.

Text: 4. Survey I also take into consideration the surrounding habitat and the range of bat species it appears likely to support, along with the quality of the habitat linkages with the wider area.

Text: 4. Survey The survey was conducted with the needs of different species of bat over the seasons in mind.

Text: 4. Survey Incidentally I comment on any relevant issues discovered with respect to bat feeding habitat and commuting routes, possibly including likely roosting sites nearby, as well as any relevant findings with respect to other protected/invasive species, biodiversity priority species and species of conservation concern.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey 5. Limitations of the survey

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey This was a preliminary survey to discover whether there are obvious signs of use by bats and to assess potential for use. If potential exists, usually follow-up work is required at dusk or dawn, possibly at a more appropriate time of year. See Appendix 3.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey The loft inspection was curtailed by wasp activity so the internal, southern gable wall was not inspected.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey It should be noted that droppings are the sign most frequently found, but they are often deposited in areas that cannot be easily visualised, if at all, and they can turn to powder quite quickly. They are usually soon washed and blown away from exposed external surfaces so evidence of use often doesn’t last long and pipistrelle bats in particular can change roosts frequently. However an assessment has been made of potential bat roosting places associated with the exterior of the building.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey The survey was carried-out in a period of rainy, breezy weather increasing the likelihood of droppings having been washed or blown from external surfaces.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey There are additional limitations to undertaking a bat survey in winter, when bats are hibernating and largely inactive. Droppings from the summer may no longer be evident.

Text: 5. Limitations of the survey As bats often roost in crevices in winter, and are particularly hard to locate when hibernating, the report will highlight any areas that could be used by bats in winter without their presence necessarily being obvious

Text: 7. Conclusions/Discussion Appendix 2 gives an outline of the criteria used in assessing the level of risk of use by bats.

Text: 7. Conclusions/Discussion There is evidence of roosting here in the form of a few bat droppings at the western gable end. I understand a single-storey extension may be added to this elevation; otherwise work involves loft conversion with possible two-storey rear extension. I believe it is not planned to re-roof. The client is of the opinion that the proposed works will not impact the bat roost directly. If the roost will be impacted directly a licence from Natural England is necessary to allow the work to proceed within the law.

Conclusions/Discussion Whether or not further survey work is needed to allow a licence from Natural England to be obtained; hinges on whether the roosting area will be directly impacted by the work. If the roof and boxed eaves within around of 1m of the west-facing gable apex will remain completely untouched, the work can be done without a licence. The number of droppings found does not suggest use by a maternity colony of bat with dependent young in summer, but as work has not been done to investigate the status of the roost, the work must be timed to avoid the main maternity colony period of May to August inclusive.

Text: 7. Conclusions/Discussion It has been assumed that the front gable will be unaffected by the work. If this is not the case, the internal front gable wall needs to be inspected, preferably when wasps cease to be likely to be active; though as this is the only area outstanding it can probably be done relatively safely any time.
