Text: Beyond connection BT are working to reduce digital inequality and help make communities better connected. From the iconic red phone boxes to the modern glass units, we’ve always been at the forefront of technology that brings people closer.

Text: Beyond connection In today’s digitally enabled world many phone boxes are sitting unused, prime sites for anti-social behaviour and vandalism. Following the success of our InLink programme where we brought free digital services to high streets across the UK, we’re further transforming our legacy payphones into state-of-the- art, fibre-connected digital community hubs – called Street Hubs.

Text: Beyond connection Not only does this remove old payphones, freeing-up space and reducing anti-social behaviour, but each Street Hub gives entire communities access to an unprecedented suite of essential free services. This includes ultrafast Wi-Fi, phone calls, wayfinding, device charging, a dedicated 999 call button and public messaging capabilities. It’s also a platform for future technologies – air quality monitoring, emergency messaging, 4G / 5G mobile coverage and more.

Text: Beyond connection Since June 2017, hundreds of first generation Streets Hubs (formerly InLinks) have gone live in cities throughout the UK, connecting over a million unique devices to Wi-Fi every month, with tens of thousands of tablet sessions and free calls each week.

Text: Beyond connection Wherever a Street Hub is installed we work with local stakeholders like councils and the police to ensure they’re a positive contribution to the area. We’re committed to addressing the few users in limited locations who abuse this service.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction The advanced nature of Street Hubs and our investment in quality systems means we can quickly identify and solve issues.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Working with local stakeholders has already led to significant technical and process advances that further help each Street Hub contribute positively to the local area.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction A small number of locations drew attention to local drug issues, with those involved misusing free call services. Following this we invested significantly in developing call restriction capabilities. These were first used to prevent calls to mobiles on select Street Hubs in problem areas – identified with the help of police and council community safety teams.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction The automatic recognition of possible misuse and blocking of identified numbers is based on a proprietary algorithm and technical process developed in consultation with the police and councils from across the UK. These consider a range of factors, including but not limited to the frequency of attempted and connected calls, the length and distribution of such calls, and insights provided by relevant stakeholders.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Once numbers are identified, their call data is continuously assessed and our algorithm always applied. When a blocked number is flagged by the algorithm this restriction is permanent. In some cases, on request, we may restrict numbers over a set period.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Should someone believe a number has been wrongly flagged, they can contact our team at streethub@bt.com who will consider the case, consulting with the police and local council where appropriate. This option will be shown on the Street Hub screen as part of the warning notification when a restricted number is dialled.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction This automatic anti-social call restriction technology is a dynamic feature of Street Hubs that can be adapted over time as further insights are gained or as patterns of misuse change.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Identification of anti-social behaviour issues

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues We take our responsibility towards community wellbeing and anti-social behaviour seriously, as evidenced by our above investment. Where possible we address any concerns before (or as part of) the planning application process which every Street Hub must go through.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Unfortunately this is not always possible, and pre-existing or emerging concerns around misuse may need to be addressed once a Street Hub is active, if not picked up by the automatic anti-social call restriction technology.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues In deciding the best course of action, advice from police, other emergency services and local authorities will always take precedence, followed by feedback from other government bodies and input from residents and businesses.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues To best identify issues and how to address them, we need:

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues • a description of the issue and when it occurred(s)

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues the location of the Street Hub(s) involved and how they contributed.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues •

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Supporting evidence is also important, where legally possible, to help us understand the issue (i.e. data or images) so that the appropriate action can be considered.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Each Street Hub is remotely monitored for service compliance 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and physically inspected and cleaned at least every two weeks. As such, any issues are likely to be quickly reported to us directly.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Where a police officer, member of the public or council officer identifies a possible anti-social behaviour issue, we can be contacted in a number of ways to take appropriate action.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Sending an email to streethub@bt.com is the main method for reporting an anti-social behaviour issue associated with a Street Hub. This will automatically raise a ticket on our system, which is actively reviewed and managed by the Street Hubs team.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Emails sent from police.uk or .gov email addresses will be treated as priority.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Technical issues like display screen failures, graffiti, etc. should be reported to streethub@bt.com.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Should it not be possible or convenient to send an email, the Street Hubs helpline is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on 08003890917.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Although we’re committed to working closely with communities to address concerns around anti- social behaviour, suspected criminal behaviour may need to be managed through official police channels by contacting 101 or 999 in an emergency.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of technical changes

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of After receiving a police crime risk assessment or report from a local authority suggesting a Street Hub may be contributing to crime or anti-social behaviour, we will assess the technical solutions available to minimise / reduce this.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of The location of each Street Hub means the way they are used and experienced varies, and so the solution will need to be bespoke.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of Where a temporary or interim technical change to a Street Hub may be considered, we work with the local council and police wherever possible to gather timely evidence and information so we understand what is happening and how best to respond. This could include:

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of reviewing the information provided from any previous tickets

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • visiting the location and meeting with local stakeholders

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of •

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of speaking with the local police and council to understand any reports they have received and what they are already doing to tackle similar issues in the area

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • collating relevant media reports, historic records, and similar

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • assessing Street Hubs data such as anonymised call information, Wi-Fi usage, etc.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of Situations that follow a similar pattern may be handled more quickly based on recommendations from groups such as the police. For example, temporarily restricting the ability to call mobile numbers where it has been proven that a Street Hub is being misused to buy illegal drugs.

Text: Implementing available technical changes Implementing available technical changes

Text: Implementing available technical changes Street Hubs are actively monitored and adaptable, with a range of temporary and interim technical measures available to help manage anti-social behaviour issues. These were part of the original design or developed as part of our dedication to community wellbeing.

Text: Implementing available technical changes These include but are not limited to:

Text: Implementing available technical changes • using the displays to include warnings and relevant information

Text: Implementing available technical changes further reducing the Street Hub’s call speaker volume

Text: Implementing available technical changes • disabling the USB port to prevent loitering around the unit

Text: Implementing available technical changes • preventing calls to types of phone numbers, such as mobile, landline or freephone

Text: Implementing available technical changes • blocking calls to specific numbers (only when agreed with the police, in addition to those captured under automatic anti-social call restriction).

Text: Implementing available technical changes We prefer to make changes in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to minimise any unintended social impact. For example, a local council or police command providing additional street teams in the area.

Text: Implementing available technical changes Our anti-social behaviour portal has advanced since the roll-out of InLink. As well as our algorithm, the portal now lets us block suspicious behaviour in real time so we can tackle any anti-social behaviour request without delay. We also have greater insight into reporting and numbers where thresholds are exceeded. These technical advances help reduce crime and allow us to work better with the police and community.

Text: Sign off and implementation Sign off and implementation

Text: Sign off and implementation Any change made to how a Street Hub is configured at a hardware or software level will require our agreement.

Text: Sign off and implementation As an OFCOM-designated Universal Service Provider of public call boxes for the provision of a publicly available telephone service, any decision to restrict provision of phone calls will need to be made exclusively by us. This will be based in part on detail provided by the police and local authority, and pay due regard to the evidence presented.

Text: Sign off and implementation We would always seek to balance any requirement to restrict Street Hub services to manage anti-social behaviour with the desire to make them available to all, as part of our work to help make communities better connected and reduce digital inequality.

Text: Review process Review process

Text: Review process Our approach to addressing anti-social behaviour associated with a Street Hub is to be collaborative. The success of any intervention relies on the police and / or councils taking reasonable steps to help address the underlying issues and the review process being tailored to each local situation.

Text: Review process In the small number of cases where the need for an operational change (such as restricting phone calls) has been identified, it will be considered temporary and applied for a limited period (typically three months but up to twelve months in high-risk locations). This temporary period allows police and the local council to investigate and take appropriate action.
