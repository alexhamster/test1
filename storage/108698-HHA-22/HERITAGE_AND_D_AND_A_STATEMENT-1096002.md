Text: Proposed development description Proposed development description

Text: Proposed development description 2.1. This householder planning application seeks permission for an extension and alterations to the rear of the existing detached garage at Barthomley, Catherine Road, Bowdon, WA14 2TD. The proposed development will accommodate some internal reconfiguration and the relocation of the staircase to increase the internal garaging space - the space being too restrictive for two vehicles to be parked internally. This will also increase the size of the first floor to allow for a home office/study area with greater separation from the main room.

Text: Site description Site description

Text: Site description 2.2. Barthomley is located at the head (in the south-west corner) of the private cul-de- sac, Catherine Road, accessed via a shared drive with Catherine House. Now semi- detached, these two properties once formed one larger single dwelling that was subdivided in the mid-1970s. The dwelling is a large three-storey property built in the Arts and Crafts style during the early 20th century. It is set within generous grounds with a large garden to the rear that backs onto St Mary’s Road where there is a gated pedestrian access.

Text: Site description 2.3. The detached garage, to which this application relates, is located to the west of the main house and was approved in 1997 (ref: H43520). It has two garage doors to the front and is 1.5 storeys in height with the upper floor using the roof space. There is a dormer window on both the front and rear roof slopes as well as a large arched feature window on the east elevation. To the rear, the roof slope overhangs the rear wall to create a canopy.

Text: Site description 2.4. The application site is located within Character Area E of the Bowdon Conservation Area. Whilst the property is not listed, it is identified as a positive contributor in the Conservation Area Appraisal. The garage is not contemporaneous with the house and is not specifically mentioned within this description.

Text: 3. Planning policy justification 3. Planning policy justification

Text: Relevant policies Relevant policies

Text: Relevant policies 3.1. The development plan relevant to this application currently consists of the Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy, 2012, and the saved policies of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan, 2006 (UDP). The National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 (The Framework) also carries significant weight as a material consideration.

Text: Relevant policies 3.2. There are also a number of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD) that are also material considerations. SPD 4 ‘A Guide for Designing Housing Extensions and Alterations’ (2012), SPD 5.9 ‘Bowdon Conservation Area Appraisal’ (2016) and SPD 5.9a ‘Bowdon Conservation Area Management Plan’ (2016) These will be specifically referred to where relevant.

Text: Key policy tests Key policy tests

Text: Key policy tests 3.3. A full policy review has been provided within Appendix C of this statement. Based on these policies we consider the five policy tests of most relevance to be:

Text: Key policy tests • Principle of development

Text: Key policy tests • Impact on the significance of the Conservation Area

Text: Key policy tests • Impact on the significance of the host dwelling as a heritage asset

Text: Key policy tests • Design and character

Text: Key policy tests • Amenity

Text: Response to tests Response to tests

Text: Response to tests Test 1: Principle of development

Text: Response to tests 3.4. Under the Trafford Local Plan, Core Strategy, the principle of new development, extensions and alterations, is considered an acceptable form of development in existing residential areas. Given the scale of this proposal, there is no specific policy guidance on the acceptability or otherwise of an extension to an incidental outbuilding. In the absence of this guidance, it is necessary to conclude a general acceptability of such works, so long as it is considered to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development as set out within the Framework (paragraph 11d).

Text: Response to tests 3.5. Any acceptability in principle would, however, be subject to a detailed consideration of the impacts on design, character and amenity – these tests will be assessed later within this statement.

Text: Response to tests 3.6. As such, due to the application site’s location within the predominantly residential area of Bowdon, the principle of this development is established.

Text: Response to tests 6

Text: Response to tests Test 2: Impact on the significance of the Conservation Area

Text: Response to tests 3.7. The application site is located within Character Zone E of the Bowdon Conservation Area (CA). As such, the potential impacts of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area must be considered as required by Core Strategy policy R1 and UDP policies ENV 21 and ENV 23. The policies contained within the Conservation Area Management Plan are also relevant.

Text: Response to tests 3.8. As set out in the Conservation Area Appraisal, the Conservation Area is characterised by, “a combination of large terraced houses, semi-detached houses and detached dwellings. The materials include red brick, Bowdon ‘white brick’ (buff and more later yellow), with render and pebble dash common on the arts and crafts houses. There is a high level of architectural integrity and detail.” The Appraisal also sets out the important role played by trees within the area, with tree-lined streets and large and vegetated gardens being noted.

Text: Response to tests 3.9. This proposed extension is located to the rear of the garage at Barthomley. As a result of this, and the depth of the property’s rear garden, the only vantage point where this would be seen is from St Mary’s Road. Views of the garage from St. Mary’s Road are significantly foiled by the mature trees and hedges on site. As a result, any potential visual impacts on the character and appearance of the wider conservation area are limited from the proposed extension and any impacts are negligible. Appendix B sets out a number of approved extensions to garages in Conservation Area. In all of these previously approved applications, the extensions were visible from the highway and thus had more impact on the character and appearance of the conservation area.

Text: Response to tests 3.10. Notwithstanding the above discussion, section 2.10 of the Management Plan clearly sets out what would be considered harmful development within the Conservation Area. The proposed development does not manifest any of these development types nor does it compromise any of the characteristics of the Conservation Area as set out in the Conservation Area Appraisal. The proposed materials are in keeping with the parent building and the extension would not reduce from the size of the garden. It is therefore considered to have no impact on the significance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Response to tests Test 3: Impact on the significance of the host dwelling as a heritage asset

Text: Response to tests 3.11. The main house, Barthomley, is named as a positive contributor within the Conservation Area Appraisal. With its immediate neighbour Catherine House, it is described as follows: “These buildings reflect a substantial number of other elements in the conservation area in age, style, materials and form… Barthomley and Catherine House are traditional in style despite being a little later - both have been altered sympathetically recently.”

Text: Response to tests 7

Text: Response to tests 3.12. Policy 44 of the Conservation Area Management Plan sets out that positive contributors must not be demolished or substantially altered in any way that dilutes their contribution to the Conservation Area. This application relates to an alteration to the detached garage associated with Barthomley rather than the property itself. As such, policy 44 is not directly relevant, however, it is important to consider how the proposed alterations and extension may impact on the character and appearance of the main dwelling.

Text: Response to tests 3.13. The garage to which this application relates was a late addition to the site in the late 1990s, replacing the existing smaller garage (ref: H43520). By way of this approval, it was considered that the construction of a detached, two-storey garage was an acceptable form of development that had an acceptable impact on the heritage asset of Barthomley.

Text: Response to tests 3.14. The proposed extension to this existing garage is located to the rear and would not be visible from the highway. No changes are proposed to the primary frontage of the garage. When viewed from the front of the property, the relationship between the house and the garage would remain unaltered.

Text: Response to tests 3.15. Additionally, the proposed works would not extend beyond the existing building envelope. Instead, it would infill the area where currently the upper floor overhangs to the rear. This will simplify the overall form of the building. This also means that the development results in no loss of green space. The proposed first floor level gable to the rear is reflective of the main scale of the building and maintains a lower ridge height. It is therefore considered that the proposed alterations would not compromise the garage’s subservience to the main house, nor its significance or contribution to the Conservation Area.

Text: Response to tests 3.16. Policy 41 of the Conservation Area Management Plan insists that development in Bowdon must be high quality and appropriate in terms of materials and detailing. The proposed materials seek to match with the existing garage and the fenestration pattern which echoes that that exists and was previously considered acceptable when the garage was approved. This is set out further within the Design Rationale document provided by the architect (Tsiantar Architects) that accompanies this application

Text: Response to tests Test 4: Design and character

Text: Response to tests 3.17. Core Strategy policy L7 sets out that design must be appropriate in terms of context and to enhance the character of the area by appropriately addressing all aspects of design including functionality and amenity. Section 3.8 of SPD 4 discusses garages more specifically setting out that they must reflect the style of the property and relate to the dwelling in scale, proportion and materials. Furthermore, Policy 11 of the Bowdon Conservation Area Management Plan (2016), “Garages should be sympathetically designed to reflect the character of their neighbouring buildings.”

Text: Response to tests 8

Text: Response to tests 3.18. This proposal can be considered compliant with this policy given that the proposed development uses materials that match the existing garage including; the brindle brickwork and blue slate roof tiles. Door and window proportion, materials and finishes are also designed to reflect the existing. Moreover, the eaves of the existing structure will be retained in order to protect the existing character and scale. The large window on the south elevation is proposed to be the same style and proportion as the existing east-facing window on the first floor of the garage. This is reflective of the existing character of the garage building but it also echoes the features of the Arts and Crafts style of the host dwelling. As such, this proposal can be deemed acceptable in accordance with the relevant design policies and guidance.

Text: Response to tests The image below clearly illustrates the proposed changes to the roofscape of the garage. As shown, this extension seeks to increase the amount of usable space on the first floor without increasing the external footprint of the garage. The photomontage image on the right highlights how just how negligible the proposed development would be to the surrounding area while creating an improved space for its residents.

Text: Response to tests 9

Text: Response to tests Test 4: Amenity

Text: Response to tests 3.19. Core Strategy policy L7 sets out the importance of ensuring that new development maintains good residential amenity as part of any design process.

Text: Response to tests 3.20. Any loss of privacy and light is considered to impact on amenity. New development should also avoid being overbearing, resulting in overlooking or other impacts such as noise disturbance. Each 0f these principles will be addressed in turn below:

Text: Privacy and overlooking Privacy and overlooking

Text: Privacy and overlooking 3.21. The proposed window on the rear elevation seeks to replace an existing dormer window. As such, this will be positioned in broadly the same location as the existing window and thus will have the same relationship with neighbouring properties as existing. As such, any impact of overlooking is considered to be negligible and therefore acceptable.

Text: Loss of light and overbearing Loss of light and overbearing

Text: Loss of light and overbearing 3.22. The first floor rear gable is proposed to have a lower ridge than the roof of the main bulk of the building. Additionally, it will not protrude beyond the existing rear elevation. The work is all south facing, with the higher ridge behind so there is unlikely to be any significant additional shadows cast than already exists. As such, any loss of sunlight afforded to the direct neighbour to the west The Tall House, in the early mornings and will be negligible. As such, there are also no concerns regarding loss of light and overlooking.

Text: Impact of noise and other disturbance Impact of noise and other disturbance

Text: Impact of noise and other disturbance 3.23. There are no concerns in this regard given the scale and nature of the proposed development. No change of use is proposed that would compromise the neighbours in terms of noise disturbance or any other as the garage and upper rooms remain incidental to the main dwellinghouse.

Text: Impact of noise and other disturbance 3.24. Therefore, this extension can be considered acceptable in terms of amenity, as per policy L7 of the development plan.

Text: Impact of noise and other disturbance 10

Text: 4. Design and access parameters 4. Design and access parameters

Text: Use and quantum Use and quantum

Text: Use and quantum 4.1. The garage is currently in C3 use, as an outbuilding that is incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwelling house, Barthomley. There is no proposed change of use as part of this application and so it will remain both in C3 use and incidental to the main house.

Text: Appearance and materials Appearance and materials

Text: Appearance and materials 4.2. The proposed extension seeks to infill where the roof currently overhangs at the rear. As such, it will not extend beyond the existing building envelope a. The building’s front elevation will remain unchanged. The existing dormer window to the rear is then proposed to be replaced with a large gable. This will have a lower ridge height than the main building and an arched window to match that on the east elevation. All materials are to match the existing building.

Text: Access and parking Access and parking

Text: Access and parking 4.3. There is no change to the access or parking arrangements by way of this proposed development. The relocation of the internal staircase will however mean that two cars fit more comfortably within the garage.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5. Heritage statement

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.1. Paragraph 128 of the NPPF requires applicants to describe the significance of any heritage assets, which may be affected, including any contributions made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the assets and should be no more than what is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.2. Barthomley was constructed during the early 20th century, likely during the 1920s in the Arts and Crafts style. The dwelling has been listed as a positive contributor in the Bowdon Conservation Area Appraisal (2016), however, there is no mention of the garage within this appraisal.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.3. Much of the value of the site is derived from the mature trees within Catherine Road and Barthomley House and the resultant atmospheric feel to the area. The garage, which was constructed in the late 1990s, holds little to no historic significance beyond its location in the setting of Barthomley.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 12

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.4. Above is the view of Barthomley from the street. Barthomley is located down the private drive to the left. As shown, the property, and the garage to which the application relates, is not visible in any part from the highway.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.5. This is the view of the garage from the front entrance of Barthomley. The proposed extension is to be located to the rear and so would not be visible from this vantage, nor when viewed against the principal elevation of the dwelling.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.6. Taking the above comments into account, whilst the main house itself is of some heritage value (given its architectural significance and its location in the conservation area), the garage building is far less so given its age. It is however, within the conservation area. As a result, the significance of the heritage asset is considered to be moderate.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 13

Text: 5. Heritage statement 5.7. Turning to the impact on its significance, it is considered that the proposed development has no impact on the significance of the heritage asset. This is based on four broad points:

Text: 5. Heritage statement • That the proposed development is neither visible from public vantage points, and as such cannot impact on the character and appearance of the conservation area as enjoyed by the public

Text: 5. Heritage statement • That the proposed development has no direct visual connection between the primary elevation or approaches to the main house, and as such would not affect the setting or character of the main house

Text: 5. Heritage statement • That any residual impact on the conservation area or the host dwelling, that would only be visible from on or near the site, are limited given that the proposed works are almost entirely within the visual envelope of the existing garage, and there is not increase in footprint, ridge height or eaves height.

Text: 5. Heritage statement • The minor increase in the overall volume of the garage building retains the garage’s subservience, in visual terms, to the host dwelling, which remains the dominant architectural feature within the plot.

Text: 5. Heritage statement 14

Text: 6. Planning balance 6. Planning balance

Text: Overall balance Overall balance

Text: Overall balance 6.1. This application relates to a small extension to create a gable to the rear of an existing garage at Barthomley. This sort of development is considered acceptable in principle as a domestic extension in a residential area.

Text: Overall balance 6.2. Whilst the main house is named as a positive contributor to the Conservation Area, the proposed extension is not considered to impact its significance as a heritage asset. The extension would not extend beyond the existing building envelope and retains the garage’s subservience to the main house. The development would not be visible from the highway, nor when viewed against the principal elevation of Barthomley. It cannot be considered therefore to have any detrimental impact on the significance of the Conservation Area and does not constitute ‘harmful development’ in the conservation area.

Text: Overall balance 6.3. The design of the proposed extension ensures that the extension would have a lower ridge than the main bulk of the building. All materials are to match the existing building and the proposed window and doors replicate those on the east elevation to reflect the Arts and Crafts style of the main dwelling. This approach is entirely in accordance with the local policy and the guidance set out in the conservation management plan.

Text: Overall balance 6.4. Therefore, this scheme is considered to be in complete compliance with policies at the local and national levels, including policies L7 and R1 from the Trafford Core Strategy, or material considerations as set out within the NPPF and the Council’s specific SPDs. It will not have any negative impact on Barthomley or the Bowdon Conservation Area.

Text: Overall balance 6.5. We respectfully request that this scheme be granted approval without delay.

Text: Revised Unitary Development Plan (2006) Relevant section/paragraph Description 3.8 Garages “It is important that garages reflect the style of the property and relate to the dwelling in scale, proportion and materials, particularly if the garage is freestanding.” “Consideration should be given to the outlook of neighbouring properties and potential overshadowing when deciding on the location of a garage. Particular problems can arise when sited in close proximity to a neighbouring boundary or habitable window, where the height or scale of a garage should be minimised in order to safeguard neighbouring amenity.” This policy is mostly concerned about garages that are highly visible from the street.
