Text: 1. Extent of development 1. Extent of development

Text: 1. Extent of development The residential family dwelling, a dormer bungalow built circa 1980, is located in the Old Market Conservation Area. See section 7 for details.

Text: 1. Extent of development The existing property has smooth red/buff multi facing brick at ground floor level with decorative stone cladding to the upper gable walls.

Text: 1. Extent of development The main roof has a brown concrete tile with a similar smaller gauge tile enveloping the rear dormer below a felted flat roof. White upvc sofiits and bargeboards have brown upvc rainwater goods attached.

Text: 1. Extent of development Windows are generally white upvc framed double glazed units.

Text: 1. Extent of development The attached garage has a felted flat roof, as does the conservatory to the rear.

Text: 1. Extent of development The detached property has driveway access from Groby Place, with access to an attached brick walled garage to the right hand side of the plot. Access onto the site is very restricted due to the width of Groby Place, and the raised planting bed to the front of the site. There is a brick wall enclosing the rear lawned garden area, with mature trees to the rear /side boundary.

Text: 1. Extent of development The applicants wish to improve the quality of the dwellings spatial planning and external fabric, mindful of the setting in a conservation area, to enhance the visual amenity along Groby Place and to the rear.

Text: 1. Extent of development The proposal is to extend to the rear of the premises at ground floor level following removal of the existing conservatory to create a living area in close contact with the garden area. The front door, currently on the side of a small porch, is to be replaced with a new door facing the road in an extended hall area below a new gabled roof.

Text: 1. Extent of development At first floor level a new gabled roof is proposed over the garage to create an additional bedroom. The existing rear dormer is to be re-clad in new contemporary materials and 2no gabled dormers added to the front roof to provide more natural light to rooms and create visual balance to the front elevation.

Text: 1. Extent of development The driveway is to be widened and the raised planting bed reduced in scale to facilitate easier vehicular access and improved access to the front door.

Text: 1. Extent of development The internal floor plan is to be re-modelled to create increased kitchen/living space at ground floor and an ensuited bedroom at first floor.

Text: 2. Layout 2. Layout

Text: 2. Layout The front door to the dwelling is on the side elevation of the porch facing Groby Place. A driveway in front of the attached garage leads to a path and gated access to the rear garden on the southern side elevation.

Text: 2. Layout The new ground floor extensions will create an improved access from the front door, a unified kitchen and living accommodation with immediate access to the rear garden. At first floor the extension over the garage will provide a new en-suited bedroom with glazed doors leading to a small balcony on the west elevation. Dormer windows and rooflights in the existing main roof will offer supplementary daylight to other bedrooms/bathrooms.

Text: 2. Layout Amenity space to the side and rear provides parking, cycle and refuse storage facilities. The private garden to the rear is to be replanted and raised beds re-profiled.

Text: 2. Layout The building lies on a relatively flat site. The ground floor level is elevated above external ground level by approximately 150mm

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal 3. Scale of the proposal

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The extensions are subservient to the existing building, which sits in a large garden plot, with no material loss of amenity space.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The proposed gabled dormers to the front are small and traditional in appearance. The roof of the first floor extension over the garage sits below the main ridgeline, and the front wall iss et back from the current front wall line.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The materials used for the external envelope will improve the quality and appearance of the building.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal There are no issues with regards to the extensions reducing/impacting on the visual amenity of adjacent dwellings.

Text: 4. Landscaping 4. Landscaping

Text: 4. Landscaping The rear private amenity space to the dwelling will have a paved surface outside the extension, leading to the existing lawned area. The widened driveway will have a paviored surface with sustainable drainage system.

Text: 4. Landscaping The existing brick boundary wall /hedging treatments will remain.

Text: 4. Landscaping 9

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment 5. Aesthetic treatment

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment The proposed extensions and render proposals seek to enhance the external appearance of the premises, using a simple unified palette of materials whilst retaining a traditional appearance of a pitched roof/gabled dwelling.

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment The external materials proposed, - retained facing brickwork, grey roof tiles, dark grey composite board to dormers, render to gable walls, grey upvc and aluminium framed windows - are to complement the finishes proposed internally, with black steel framed glazed screens and timber doors to serve the new rooms. A single ply covered flat roof with lantern rooflight will provide a contemporary addition to the rear of the dwelling.

Text: 6. Access proposal 6. Access proposal

Text: 6. Access proposal The proposal seeks to improve the vehicular and pedestrian access to the premises from Groby Place, for the benefit of the applicant and other residents along Groby Place. At present there is no facility for visitors, who have to park on the narrow road, restricting its use for others, deliveries, refuse collections etc.

Text: 6. Access proposal The extension will have access from the existing Hallway, or alternatively external access will be available from the garden via a new stepped approach.

Text: 7. Context 7. Context

Text: 7. Context The premises lie in The Old Market Conservation Area, first designated in 1973 and extended numerous times, most recently in 2014. This Conservation Area is situated close to the centre of Altrincham.

Text: 7. Context 11

Text: 7. Context Conservation Area designation recognises the unique quality of an area as a whole. It is not just the contribution of individual buildings and monuments, but also that of features such as topography, layout of roads, pathways, street furniture, open spaces, and hard and soft landscaping which assist in defining the character and appearance of an area. Conservation Areas identify the familiar and cherished local scene that creates a sense of place, community, distinctiveness and environment. The extent to which a building positively shapes the character of a Conservation Area depends not just on their street elevations but also on their integrity as historic structures and the impact they have in three dimensions, perhaps in an interesting roofscape, or skyline. Back elevations can be important, as can side views from alleys and yards.

Text: 7. Context The special interest of the Old Market Place Conservation Area is defined in the Conservation Area Appraisal as ‘the medieval settlement core of Altrincham that retains evidence of the pre-1290 Charter layout in the current street scene. The Conservation Area has the character of an historic market town with a variety of inter-linked building types including civic, commercial and residential. The majority of buildings are 19th century or earlier and have high aesthetic value for architectural detailing and local distinctiveness. Small scale buildings utilising historic burgage plots front the street to create a strong building line and traditional materials give a sense of visual harmony. The Conservation Area is the meeting point of several major routes and the Market Place and later Market Street are a significant public gathering place, illustrating the continuous inhabitance of Altrincham from the medieval period to the present day. The continued use of the Historic Market Quarter of Altrincham as a vibrant civic and communal space makes it a significant heritage asset to the town’.

Text: 7. Context The applicants property is not listed. Nos 3-4 Groby Place, Edwardian period properties, have been subject of article 4 direction proposals. There are no listed buildings within the immediate vicinity of the site.

Text: 7. Context The dwelling is located to the north of Altrincham town centre with a full range of amenities and transport links available.

Text: 7. Context 12

Text: 7. Context 13

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment 8. Visual Impact Assessment

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The topography and screened rear garden areas, and limited outward looking fenestration will ensure no loss of amenity for neighbouring premises.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment Having regard to the site’s context the main heritage issues raised by this proposal would appear to be the potential impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the Old Market Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment This property is part of a frontage to Groby Place, which is located in the Conservation Area due to the presence of more prominent Edwardian premises rather than the application property.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment However, given its low building form, relatively late historical development and isolated position in respect of the more historic properties within the Conservation Area, the property makes only a modest contribution to its character and appearance.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The rear elevation is not a prominent element in the Conservation Area and the proposed extension will not be seen in the context of the wider Conservation Area. It is therefore considered that whilst the alterations to the rear elevation will result in some changes to the overall appearance of the property, they will not adversely impact on the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The proposals to add gabled dormers to the front, remodel the front door and extend over the garage seek to improve the character and quality of the dwelling as part of the streetscene.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment It is therefore considered that the proposed extensions will not harm the prevailing character or appearance of the Conservation Area and the considered design of the proposed extensions will maintain the high quality of the built environment within this Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment 14

Text: 9. Conclusion 9. Conclusion

Text: 9. Conclusion In conclusion the applicant is striving to modify and extend an existing building in a manner that fits comfortably within its environment and that complements the surrounding architecture. The applicants’ brief is to extend and improve the existing building, with good quality materials and detailing, that meets, as a minimum the current building legislation requirements for quality of construction and thermal performance, which represent a worthwhile investment, and can be implemented without imposition on the neighbouring buildings.

Text: 9. Conclusion In terms of footprint and massing the proposal is not a significant increase on the existing building footprint. The proposal responds well to its context, utilizing the existing aspect whilst seeking to maintain privacy for the occupants and the neighbouring residents.

Text: 9. Conclusion For the reasons set out above it is considered that the proposed development will not harm the character or appearance of the Old Market Conservation Area, or its overall significance. Consequently, this proposal complies with the requirements of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act and the local and national policy objectives that seek to protect the significance of heritage assets.
