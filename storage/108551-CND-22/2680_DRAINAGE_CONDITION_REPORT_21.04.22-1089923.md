Text: 1.0 Introduction In 2020 a planning application was submitted to Trafford Council for the Change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings, works to include: erection of single and two storey side and rear extensions plus basement and replacement rear dormers following demolition of existing side extensions and outbuilding; roof alterations; installation of eyelet windows on front façade; and other elevational alterations; as well as erection of car port at rear and associated landscaping works at the former St Johns Medical Centre , St Johns Road, Altrincham, WA14 2NW.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.1.1

Text: 1.0 Introduction To the south of the site in St John’s Road is a 225mm diameter combined water sewer flowing east to the larger sewer in Ashley Road. There are no surface water sewers in close proximity.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.1.2 A CCTV survey has been completed within the current site. Serving the building and rear car park is a network of private combined drains that outfall unrestricted to the combined sewer in St John’s Road via two connections.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.2 Existing Runoff

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.2.1 The existing site is fully developed with impermeable roof and car park areas, and therefore the site can be considered to be fully Brownfield. As such the existing brownfield flow rates from the site have been defined in the table below based on the area of the redevelopment.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3 Geology

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3.1 A detailed site-specific intrusive investigation has been carried out at the site. This identified shallow made ground over loose brown sand to a maximum depth of 9m BGL. Refer to Figure 3 below for an extract of the window sample at the location of the infiltration tank. No formal soakaway tests were completed at the time of the investigation. However, based on the underlying sand, infiltration is very likely to be suitable. In lieu of any tests an infiltration rate of 1.4x10-4 m/s (0.5m/hr) has been used in the hydraulic calculations.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach detail below:

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach Method Suitability Suitability for Development Infiltration to Ground Yes Intrusive site investigations would indicate that the underlying ground is suitable for infiltration. Connection to Watercourse No No watercourse in close proximity. Connection to Surface Water Sewer No No surface water sewer in close proximity. Connection to a Combined Sewer No Infiltration option takes precedent.

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy The SuDS assessment and hierarchal approach discussed in Figure 4 above has defined the overall SuDS strategy. The general principal of the surface water drainage strategy is to collect the runoff from the roof of the residential dwellings the existing and new downpipes. The water will then be directed to a new below ground surface water drainage network that will outfall to a geocellular infiltration tank located in the rear car parking area. The car park area itself will drain to the permeable surfacing located in the parking bays. This approach significantly reduces the runoff from the site to the downstream combined sewer network.

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy Each point of conditions 15 & 16 are listed below in italics with the Brennan Consult response

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy beneath in Blue.

Text: Condition 15 Condition 15

Text: Condition 15 The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced unless and until a scheme to improve the surface water disposal from the site has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be one of the two options listed below and must be in accordance with the drainage hierarchy:

Text: Condition 15 • Dwg No. (PL) 018 Rev. A (Infiltration Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 • Dwg No. (PL) 018 (Attenuated Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The SuDS hierarchal approach has been considered in Section 2. The site investigation has informed that infiltration is viable. A conservative rate for loose sand of 1.14x10-4 has been used at this time and the hydraulic calculations prepared using this rate to define the tank size. Overall SuDS will take the form of an infiltration tank and permeable paving.

Text: Condition 15 Refer to Appendix A for the drainage GA and Appendix B for the hydraulic calculations.

Text: Condition 16 Condition 16

Text: Condition 16 The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied unless and until a management and mainte- nance plan to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme for the lifetime of the devel- opment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The manage- ment and maintenance plan shall include the arrangements for adoption by an appropriate public body or statutory undertaker, management and maintenance by a Residents' Management Company or any other arrangements to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme throughout its lifetime. The management and maintenance plan shall be implemented for the lifetime of the de- velopment.

Text: Condition 16 The long-term maintenance of the new private (non adopted) drainage infrastructure will be with the property owners and a maintenance company in line with best practice guidance. Annual inspections will need to be carried out and clearing of drainage chambers, gullies and permeable paving. Typically the maintenance regime will be in line with Figure 5 below.
