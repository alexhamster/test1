Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection The buildings were assessed as to their suitability to support bats following standard methodologies prescribed in English Nature’s Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell-Jones 2004)2 and the Bat Conservation Trust’s Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines 3rd Edition (BCT 2016)3.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection Survey, comprising of an inspection of the interior and exterior of the building, was undertaken during daylight conditions using binoculars, endoscope and a high-powered torch. The survey was undertaken during daylight hours on the 20th June 2022.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection In addition to searching for evidence of an actual bat roost the survey also aimed to assess the suitability of the building to support bats and consequently the likelihood of a bat roost being present but with no obvious field signs.

Text: 2.2.1 Daytime Bat Inspection Survey assessed each building’s roost suitability by examining structural features and the surrounding habitat. Structural features that will influence the suitability of a building to support roosting bats include the presence of a roof void; access points into a building including gaps beneath barge boards, gaps under lead flashing, gaps within masonry, loose tiles etc, complexity of any roof void, daytime light levels in roof void etc.

Text: 3.1 Site Description 3.1 Site Description

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site comprises a group of buildings located at 70-72 George Street, Altrincham. The buildings extend back from George Street along an alleyway to Central Way and extend over an approximate 800 m² area.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The buildings comprise of two retail units, a bar/café and a gymnasium. The buildings comprise of a combination of flat-roofed and pitched roof structures arranged over one and two stories. The buildings are connected to one another and are constructed of brick. The buildings are considered likely to be mid-20th century origin.

Text: 3.1 Site Description An alleyway runs along the north-eastern edge of the buildings, whilst the Everyman Theatre building (which is a large, flat-roofed, brick built, modern structure) is located along the southwestern edge of the buildings. George Street is located to the southeast of the site, whilst Central Way is located to the northwest of the site.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site is located in the centre of the Altrincham town. Surrounding habitats are therefore highly modified and urbanised comprising principally of further retail units, paved areas and streets. There are no significant areas of park, woodland or other high quality bat foraging habitat located within proximity to the site.

Text: 3.1 Site Description Therefore, surrounding habitats are considered to offer ‘very low’ quality bat foraging habitat.

Text: 3.1 Site Description The study site’s location is shown in Figure 1 in the Appendix. The site layout is shown on Figure 2. Photographs of the site are also shown in the Appendix.

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey 3.2 Bat Survey

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey Surveyed buildings are numbered 1-3 and show Figure 2 in the Appendix.

Text: 3.2 Bat Survey Building 1 is located on Central Way. The ground floor of the building comprises of a café/bar. This part of the building is open at its west face and comprises of just steel girders, with no walls. The girders support the upper floor of the building which is brick built and has a shallow, pitched roof clad in tightly fitted mineral felt. Internally, the upper floor of the building comprises of a single open room which is used as a gymnasium. The upper floor room does not have a separate loft space, however there is a false ceiling constructed of polystyrene tiles.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report The upper floor room is brightly lit by windows and so both the ground floor and upper floor of the building are considered to be entirely unsuitable for bats. Externally, the building does not support any obvious suitable bat roosting features and was considered to be well sealed and intact.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Building 2 comprises of flat-roofed, two story buildings which are attached to Building 1 and form part of the gymnasium complex. These buildings are also constructed of brick and the roofs are clad in tightly fitted, mineral felt. The buildings have skylights and windows and so internally, are brightly lit. The buildings do not have separate roof void spaces. The buildings are well sealed offering no obvious bat roosting features or access to the building interior or the building’s wall structure.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Building 3 comprises of two adjacent retail units which face onto George Street. The ground floors of the units comprise of the store’s shopfronts, whilst the upper floors house the shop offices and storage areas. These buildings are also constructed of brick and the roofs are also clad in tightly fitted, mineral felt. The buildings do not have separate roof void spaces and the interiors are considered entirely unsuitable for roosting bats. The buildings are well sealed offering no obvious bat roosting features or access to the building interior or wall structure. These buildings are also considered to be negligible suitability for roosting bats.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report The buildings are all likely to be brightly lit from George Street and Central Way and to also suffer frequent human disturbance.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report No bat field signs were found at the site. No current or historic evidence of nesting bird activity was identified at site, and the buildings do not support any suitable bird nesting cavities.

Text: 70-72 George Street Bat Scoping Report Taking account of the buildings’ locations in a highly urbanised environment and the absence of any obvious potential bat roosting features, all buildings were assessed as offering a ‘negligible’ bat roosting potential.

Text: 4.1 Summary 4.1 Summary

Text: 4.1 Summary The daytime inspection did not identify any field signs indicative of roosting bats. Furthermore, the buildings at the site were found to be unsuitable for roosting bats as they are well sealed, offering no suitable roosting features and are located in a highly urbanised area. Therefore, the buildings were assessed as offering a ‘negligible’ bat roosting potential and it is considered to be very unlikely that the site would support any active bats roosts.

Text: 4.1 Summary No current or historic evidence of nesting bird activity was identified at site, and the buildings do not support any suitable bird nesting cavities.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements 4.2 Site Enhancements

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements Although the site is located within an urban area, it is recommended that that the development is enhanced to provide suitable nesting habitat for urban bird species.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements This can be achieved through the installation of swift and sparrow nest boxes into the proposed new buildings at the site.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The bird boxes can be built into the brick walls of the proposed buildings so as to remain visually unobtrusive.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The precise location, model and number of bird boxes should be determined by an appropriately qualified ecologist.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements It is also recommended that new landscaping is provided at the site including tree planting. Where possible this should comprise of native species can provide nectar sources for insects and berries/fruits for invertebrates and birds.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements The following small/medium sized tree species are recommended as they offer suitable foraging opportunities to various native wildlife (including birds and invertebrates): rowan, wild cherry, crab apple, silver birch, holly, and willow.

Text: 4.2 Site Enhancements Any areas of new shrubbery should include suitable nectar sources for insects. The Royal Horticultural Society provides a list of suitable plants for invertebrates (see rhs.org.uk/plantsforpollinators). recommended that this list is consulted when producing any detailed landscaping designs for the site.

Text: 2.1 Building Regulations The Building Regulations Approved Document Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) 2021 outline the requirements for reductions in carbon emissions and primary energy required for new developments.

Text: 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012) 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012)

Text: 2.2 Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (Adopted Jan 2012) Planning applications are currently assessed against the Core Strategy which sets out an overarching strategy and development principles for Trafford to guide development until at least 2026. The relevant policies are extracted from the Local Plan Strategy Document:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Major built development proposals will be required to demonstrate how they will seek to minimise their contribution towards and/or mitigate their effects on climate change, in line with both national standards and local opportunities and programmes. For the purposes of this policy, “major development” is defned as comprising:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Residential development equal to or greater than 10 units; and

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Non-Residential development above a threshold of 1,000m2 floor area.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Development will need to demonstrate how it contributes towards reducing CO2 emissions within the Borough. This should include incorporating measures such as applying sustainable design and construction techniques prior to utilising renewable energy generation technologies, examples of which can be found in the supporting Technical Note.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The policy provides targets for major development to deliver different CO2 reduction targets as follows:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGAs) - where there is potential to deliver CO2 reduction target of up to 15% above current Building Regulations; and

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change • Outside LCGAs - where there is potential to deliver CO2 reduction target of up to 5% above current Building Regulations.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change CO2 emissions should be reduced by applying the following hierarchy:

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 1. Design and construction techniques to reduce the demand for energy (for example: through the orientation of building; internal layout; and superior energy efficiency measures such as extra insulation);

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2. Technology (for example through sourcing low carbon or renewable energy generation, including any district energy network which may be accessible).

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The Trafford Low Carbon Study (2011) identified opportunities across the Borough to reduce CO2 emissions by more than the national standards. In key areas of the Borough identified as Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGA’s) the reduction could be up to 15%, dependent on the nature of the

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change development being proposed. The LCGAs identified are Altrincham Town Centre, Carrington and Trafford Park.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change The Trafford Low Carbon Study (2011) details that up to 5% CO2 reduction above national standards can be achieved outside of LCGAs where realistic opportunities exist to connect to existing low/zero carbon energy generating facility(s).

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.2.2 Pollution

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Development that has potential to cause adverse pollution (of air, light, water, ground), noise or vibration will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that adequate mitigation measures can be put in place.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Where development is proposed close to existing sources of pollution, noise or vibration, developers will be required to demonstrate that it is sited and designed in such a way as to confine the impact of nuisance from these sources to acceptable levels appropriate to the proposed use concerned.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change Within the Borough’s Air Quality Management Zones developers will be required to adopt measures identified in the Greater Manchester Air Quality Action Plan, to ensure that their development would not have an adverse impact on the air quality.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change 2.3 SPD1: Planning Obligations Technical Note 3: Climate Change (Feb 2012)

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change This document is a supporting technical note for the core strategy climate change policy L5 and Planning Obligations SPD1.

Text: 2.2.1 L5 Climate Change This document confirms that areas of high development growth termed Low Carbon Growth Areas (LCGAs) have been identified to have the potential to deliver higher carbon emissions reduction targets of up to 15% above current Building Regulations, with the rest of the Borough to deliver up to 5% above current Building Regulations.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy This development follows the principles to make the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the following energy hierarchy:

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be lean: use less energy

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be clean: supply energy efficiently

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy • Be green: use renewable energy

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy 3.2 New Residential Buildings

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The intention is to adopt an enhanced building fabric based on values which are better than the minimum required for compliance with Building Regulations AD Part L 2021 as outlined in Table A below. This will minimise the building energy demand and contribute towards Building Regulations compliance.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy Table B – Proposed efficient building services system

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The proposal is to provide a fabric first solution by minimising heat loss through the thermal elements. Heating will be provided by a Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) System and direct electric heating for small spaces. A small PV array will be utilised to meet compliance with the Planning Requirement.

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The building has been modelled in IES VE software to assess the performance of the building against Part L (See Section 7 for Part L BRUKL document).

Text: 3.1 Energy Hierarchy The assessment showed that 10kWp of PV panels would be required to exceed the 15% improvement on building regulations required by planning; with an actual improvement of 16.9%. This would equate to 50m2 panel area at an efficiency of 20%. The photovoltaic panels could be positioned on the roof as shown below, so that it would not be seen from ground level

It is proposed to fully review the inclusion of photovoltaic panels at this stage to best suit the scheme.

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution 4 Consideration for Pollution

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution There will be no energy generation from gas or other fossil or solid fuel (eg Biomass) associated with regulated building services and therefore there are no additional local pollutants generated from equipment flues associated with the building services within these buildings.

Text: 4 Consideration for Pollution Ventilation provided to the building is via Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR). This provides a ‘best practice’ ventilation strategy according to the Energy Saving Trust, which controls indoor pollutes more adequately from volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), allergens (e.g. dust mites), odours from cooking and bodies, moisture etc.

Text: 5 Conclusion 5 Conclusion

Text: 5 Conclusion The analysis shows that the proposed all electric building takes advantage of the de carbonisation of the grid, reducing the carbon emissions significantly closer to net zero than a building which uses gas for heating and hot water.

Text: 5 Conclusion The buildings exclude the use of combustion equipment for providing space heating and hot water and therefore there will be no additional local pollution sources associated with the building services.

Text: 5 Conclusion The Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) ‘best practice’ ventilation strategy will provide the best internal environment for occupants

Text: 5 Conclusion The information obtained from the current design activity demonstrates that a building complying with Building Regulations AD Part L and planning requirements of a CO2 reduction target of up to 15% above current Building Regulations as required for a Low Carbon Growth Areas. Initial SBEM calculations showed that the building achieved a 16.9% improvement on building regulations, when constructed utilising the fabric performance values outlined in Table A and the system performance parameters outlined in Table B above.

Text: SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT

Text: SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT The development site is located centrally within Altrincham and straddles the land between Centralway and George Street. As existing the site is home to 2 retail units fronting George Street and 1 food and drink venue operating onto Centralway. Within close proximity to Altrincham Market and various leisure offerings, the site is a prime location for new development and has the potential to beneficially contribute to Altrincham’s growing vibrancy.

Text: Centralway Centralway

Text: Centralway Centralway has historically been considered to be a service road, serving the many retail units fronting George Street. As the market quarter has grown in popularity in recent years, its possible to see the change as more offerings spread down Centralway from Shaws Road. The design of the proposals seeks to become part of this growth and will provide an active frontage onto Centralway by the means of a food and drink venue. Above, the proposals will create 3 floors of A grade offices, of which Altrincham

Text: Centralway is highly in need of.

Text: George Street George Street

Text: George Street George Street, the main strand of the George Street Conservation Area, is Altrincham’s main retail location and Altrincham’s historic medieval lower town. The typology of its architecture is varied and eclectic. Often the shop-fronts are of less Architectural interest than the upper storeys, where the merit can be seen in Georgian and Victorian frontages, displaying their character in the form of brick detailing of various colours and

Text: George Street the use of vertical window hierarchy.

Text: George Street The proposals seek to re-invigorate the frontage to George Street, which is arguably dated and no longer appropriate for a building in such a prime location in the Conservation Area. The proposals will take architectural cues from the adjacent buildings both in scale and detailing, whilst maintaining a contemporary feel as to not appear pastiche.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT Taking a broader view of the sites location its possible to identify the ‘Market Quarter’ in which it sits. In this document this is defined by the square parcel of land which encompasses Greenwood Street, Centralway, and Shaws Road.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT This area has been very clearly defined by the Markets influence in recent years and is host to Altrincham;s most popular food, drink and leisure offerings. By identifying this we can understand the context into which the proposals will sit, which in turn has informed the many design decisions that have been made.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT To the South East of the Market Quarter, George Street acts as an arterial route through Altrincham, connecting solely via Shaws Road. As a design driver, the proposals intend to create a new link from George Street to Centralway. This connection is an important aspect of the proposals. Connecting these important streets will alleviate their perceived separation in urban deign terms and create activity within the site,

This transport hub is extermely well connected by rail bus and tram and fuels the daytime and nughttime econcmy of Altrincham. This is key in contributing to the sustainability of the site and the proposals ,which will more than likely be used by people who travle via Altrincham Interchange.

Text: AMOUNT The amount of the proposals are deemed to be appropriate to the capacity of the site and its wider context. The proposals seek to create 2 distinct and reasonably proportioned buildings fronting onto both streets, whilst creating an intimate courtyard between which breaks up the mass of the scheme and creates a new and exciting parcel of public realm in the town.

Text: INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS

Text: INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS 01_ The site itself is long and thin and has distinct and differing presentations to both Centralway and George Street. It is landlocked to one side by the Everyman and projects ahead of The Bricklayers Arms. Centralway opposes George Street’s conventional frontages with its informality. 02_ There is an existing ginnel that runs through the site. This is unattractive and therefore rarely used. The proposals will seek to re-introduce the lost connection between Centralway and George Street. 03_ As a result of the proposed route through, the proposals will look to create a new space within the site as an intention to activate the whole site, rather than solely the two frontages. 04_ In 3 dimensions the site can be represented as a cuboid. 05_ Bounded by George Street and Centrakway he proposasl seek to split the mass of the site. 06_ By carving a space in the centre of the mass we can create 2 new hidden frontages. 07_ The bulk of the mass is now split, creating new public realm and activation

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY From an early stage in the design process the design team has looked to Altrincham’s

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY existing fabric to understand the palette of materials and forms into which the scheme

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY will sit.

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY Although predominantly traditional, materials have been widely used around Altrincham to create a distinctive palette of red brick, painted and rusted metal, light sandstone, glazing and striking patterns. This palette has been created over time and can be seen in some of Altrincham oldest to most recent buildings.

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY It is this strong material and colour palette which the proposals intend to celebrate. Creating a place that evokes familiarity has been at the front of the team’s design ethos. Th scheme will acknowledge its place in the conservation area and therefore its forms will be influenced by the shapes of Altrincham. The scheme has focused on the gable feature, window heirarchy and treatments and the courtyard.

Text: SITE PLAN The site layout has been thoroughly worked through and addresses the several design drivers discussed earlier in this document, alongside the expected functional requirements for the site such as access, cycle parking and refuse.

Text: SITE PLAN The proposals can be understood as 2 distinct buildings facing either Centralway or George Street. In between these there is a landscaped courtyard wihich has ramped and stepped access and leads to the leisure and office units.The courtyard is integral in balancing the levels difference between George Street and Centralway and will form an exciting piece of public realm in Altrincham.

Text: ACCESS CONCLUSION

Text: ACCESS The proposals outlined in this statement have shown evidence of a well considered design proposal which addresses its Conservation Area context and provides high quality accommodation which will be a significant benefit to Altrincham town centre.

Text: ACCESS The site itself is challenging and unique in nature, where each frontage is of equal importance. The team has endeavoured to address and pre-empt, where appropriate, local authority concerns, resulting in a tried, tested and bespoke design solution.

Text: ACCESS In terms of accommodation the building is providing 5 storeys of grade A office accommodation, 2 storeys of leisure accommodation and 1 storey of retail accommodation. The scheme has 100% cycle storage and contains all the appropriate facilities for a contemporary mixed use development.

Text: ACCESS In form the building is contemporary, but nods to traditional materials and familiar silhouettes and is well suited to the area, which is characterized by traditional but unique architecture.

Text: ACCESS This scheme is a significant opportunity to provide Altrincham with much needed office and leisure accommodation in the form of a high quality, well designed scheme that will stand the test of time. As such the proposals should be considered for approval.

Text: 1. Introduction 1. Introduction

Text: 1. Introduction 1.1 This Heritage Statement has been prepared by Turley (Heritage and Townscape) on behalf of Veriti and Co Ltd in connection with redevelopment (‘the Proposed Development’ of 70-72 George Street, Altrincham (‘the Site’).

Text: 1. Introduction The full description of the Proposed Development is as follows:

Text: 1. Introduction “Demolition of 70 and 72 George Street and replacement with part 3, part 4 storey (plus basement) commercial building with central courtyard, external seating to Central Way, hard landscaping to the ginnel and all associated works”.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.3 The Site is within the George Street Conservation Area. Therefore, in determining the submitted full planning application, Trafford Council has a statutory duty under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the designated area1.

Text: 1. Introduction The Site adjoins the southern boundary of the Old Market Place Conservation Area. The effect of future development on the character and appearance (significance) of the Old Market Place Conservation Area is therefore also a consideration, as a result of development within its setting.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.4

Text: 1. Introduction 1.5 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) provides the Government’s national planning policy on the conservation of the historic environment. In respect of information requirements for applications, it sets out that:

Text: 1. Introduction “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.” 2

Text: 1. Introduction 1.6

Text: 1. Introduction To comply with these requirements, Section 2 of this Statement identifies heritage assets with potential to be affected by the Proposed Development. An overview of the history and development of the Site and surrounding area is provided at Section 3 and the significance and setting of the identified heritage assets is described at Section 4, including consideration of the contribution made by the Site. An assessment of the impact of the Proposed Development, with reference to relevant legislation, national and local planning policy considerations is set out in Section 5.

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets 2. The Heritage Assets

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021 defines a heritage asset as:

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets “A building, monument, site, place, area, or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions because of its heritage interest”3

Text: Designated Heritage Assets Designated Heritage Assets

Text: Designated Heritage Assets 2.2 Designated heritage assets are those which possess a level of heritage interest that justifies designation under the relevant legislation and are then subject to particular procedures in planning decisions that involve them.

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas 2.3 The Site is within the George Street Conservation Area, originally designated in March 1987. Trafford Council adopted a Conservation Area Character Appraisal for the designated area in October 2014 and a Management Plan was subsequently adopted in March 2016. The conservation area is recorded on the Historic England Heritage at Risk, North West Register (2021). It is classed as being in poor condition, with low vulnerability and with a ‘deteriorating’ trend.

Text: Conservation Areas 2.4

Text: Conservation Areas The Old Market Place Conservation Area is located to the north west of the Site. Trafford Council also adopted a Character Appraisal and Management Plan for this conservation area in 2014 and 2016.

Text: Listed Buildings Listed Buildings

Text: Listed Buildings 2.5 The closest listed building to the Site is the grade II listed Market House. The substantial market hall of 1879 is classically influenced and occupies a prominent position at the corner of Market Street and Shaw’s Road. With the exception of views along Market Street and Greenwood Street, the building is primarily experienced within close proximity on Market Street and Shaw’s Road, where the distinction, architectural and historic interest of the Victorian market hall can be experienced and appreciated in contrast to neighbouring buildings.

Text: Listed Buildings 2.6 The Site is located to the south east of the listed building, separated from it by intervening buildings lining Greenwood Street and Central Way. Due to this degree of separation and the screening effect of existing buildings, it is not considered likely that the Proposed Development would be visible from the Market House or have any impact on significance of the asset. It has therefore been excluded from assessment.

Text: Listed Buildings The heritage assets assessed in this Statement are those identified as having potential to be affected by the Proposed Development. This is based on a series of judgements including the nature of their significance and relative contribution of setting, their proximity to and relationship with the Site, potential visibility of the Proposed Development and any known functional or historic associations.

Text: Listed Buildings 2

Text: Listed Buildings 2.8 It is possible that the proposed building will be visible from other heritage assets not individually assessed within the Statement. In accordance with the NPPF and Historic England guidance the judgements made are based on the effect of the Proposed Development on the significance of the identified assets, rather than whether the development will be visible from them, although this is also a consideration.

Text: Site Location and Context Site Location and Context

Text: Site Location and Context 3.1 The Site comprises nos. 70 & 72 George Street, Altrincham and is a rectangular area of land currently occupied by modern flat roof two storey brick buildings with retail frontages to George Street, a complex of single storey extensions to the rear and a taller building with a pitched roof facing Central Way. It is bounded to the south east by George Street and to the north west by Central Way. The north eastern boundary of the Site is formed by a ginnel connecting George Street and Central Way. To the immediate south west of the Site is the adjacent property of 74 George Street and to the north east, beyond the ginnel, is The Bricklayers public house.

Text: Site Location and Context The Site lies on the north western side of George Street, a pedestrianised shopping street in Altrincham town centre. George Street runs from its junction with Regent Road in a north easterly direction as far as the modern shopping centre of the Stamford Building. Building heights along the street vary and comprise a combination of two to three storey 18th and 19th century buildings and modern late 20th and early 21st century commercial buildings of varying heights.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.3

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century In 1290 a Royal Charter by King Edward I allowed for a weekly market in Altrincham and a three day annual fair on the Feast of the Assumption. At the same time a second charter was created providing a plan for the borough including details of its administration and the way of life of its population. This led to the expansion of the medieval town to the south (corresponding with the modern areas of George Street, Market Street, Kingsway and Shaws Road) and the settlement was arranged in a series of narrow rectangular plots, perpendicular to these routes.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century A significant development for Altrincham in the 18th century was the construction of the Bridgewater Canal in 1765, which improved transport links to Manchester and resulted in greater prosperity. The road to Chester was turnpiked in 1752, with the section as far as Manchester completed by 1765. In addition, a mail coach and stage coach service between Manchester, Knutsford and Chester was introduced. These developments resulted in substantial population growth and a notable phase of re- building and development in Altrincham and the surrounding area. Many medieval properties were replaced by brick buildings, or timber framed buildings were upgraded in the new Georgian style. The 1835 Tithe Map5 indicates that by this time George Street was lined by residential properties fronting the street, with gardens to the rear.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.4

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.5 A branch line of the railway from Manchester to Altrincham was also constructed during this period to the south east of the Site, as shown on the 1882 Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.2). Several new public buildings were constructed to the south and east of the Old Market Place, including Altrincham General Hospital and a Library and Technical School on George Street.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.6 Stamford New Road was created in 1880 and a new railway station, further to the north, opened in 1881. The old station became a carriage shed. The creation of the new road affected land to the east of George Street. New Stamford Road became the focus of the town’s commercial development and George Street was subject to increasing commercial pressure; redevelopment effectively changing the street’s character from residential to commercial.

Text: Development of the Site prior to the end of the 19th century The 1835 Tithe Map6 is the first plan to show the Site in detail. The map indicates that by 1835 George Street was lined by residential properties with gardens to the rear. The properties now known as The Bricklayers Arms and no. 70 George Street are shown set back from the established building line. The map appears to show that the plot of no. 72 George Street was occupied by a building aligned north west to south east, and in combination with the properties to the north, formed a small enclosed square on the northern side of George Street. This arrangement of buildings is also shown on the 1852 Altrincham Board of Health plan7.

Text: Development of the Site prior to the end of the 19th century The 1876 Town Plan (Figure 3.3) shows the south western part of the Site occupied by two small buildings fronting onto George Street, with a series of small buildings to the rear. Adjacent buildings to the south all fronted onto George Street, following the same consistent building line. The north eastern part of the Site (no. 70) and the adjacent building (now known as the Bricklayers Arms) remained set back from the street elevation, forming a small open square. When viewed within the wider context (Figure 3.4) it is clear that at this time development was focussed along George Street. A Volunteer Drill Hall and a Unitarian Chapel were situated to the west of the Site, but the majority of land here remained undeveloped and in use as a drill ground. Some of the side streets such as George’s Square and Shaw’s Lane (to the north of the Site) had been developed with terraced properties by this time.

A more dense urban grain had been established with increasing infill development including terraced housing to the rear of properties along the north western side of George Street. This contrasted with the larger villas, set within gardens, developed away from the town centre further west.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day The trend of redevelopment, alteration and extension of properties within Altrincham town centre continued from the late 19th century into the 20th century. Properties in George Street, previously dwellings, were increasingly converted to commercial use.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day 3.11 To the west of the site, during the early 20th century a number of new buildings were constructed around the market hall, including the Town Hall (1901) and a covered market constructed to the south of the market hall (1908-1937) (Figure 3.7). These civic and commercial buildings were of greater scale than the generally small scale and finer grain of earlier development and dwellings of the town centre. Public facilities on George Street were also improved, for example through the extension of the library and adjacent art gallery in 1928 and 1934, and the construction of the Stamford Public Hall in 1940; at the northern end of George Street.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day 3.12 Post war, a series of slum clearances were undertaken along with larger scale redevelopment of the town centre. The Grafton Centre was constructed at the southern end of George Street, combining retail and commercial uses and incorporating a high rise block. Further redevelopment followed the establishment of a policy for the redevelopment of the town centre, and significant redevelopment occurred including the creation of a pedestrianised shopping area, and the creation of a raised carpark and department store at the northern end of George Street. These late 20th century buildings in the vicinity of the Site were of considerably greater scale, massing and height than their predecessors.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.13 The Ordnance Survey map as surveyed in 1908 (Figure 3.6) shows that the Site was redeveloped at the turn of the century, erasing former burgage plots. Historic photographs held by Trafford Council archives show No. 70 and 72 George Street in advance of this redevelopment. The small square, enclosed on its southern side by No. 72 George Street, had by this time become known as ‘Old Beggars Square’. An additional photograph shows no. 72 George Street when demolition works were in progress; the large number of advertisements visible on the building may suggest it had been vacant for a period of time prior to its removal.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.14 The 1908 Ordnance Survey map shows that the previous terrace of properties at the rear of the Site had been cleared and replaced with a building named as ‘S.A. Hall’ (Salvation Army Hall), and an apparent new building added to George Street, with a rear yard and outbuilding. The building at the westernmost (rear) part of the Site appears to be unchanged from that shown on earlier editions of the map. A ginnel entrance ran from George Street to the rear of the Site at its south eastern corner. No 70 George Street remained unchanged, as did the remainder of other properties fronting onto George Street. Further to the east, the map shows that additional commercial properties had been constructed fronting onto the newly created Stamford New Road, which is shown as the route of a new Tramway.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 9

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.15 Redevelopment of the area continued during the 20th century. The 1936/7 Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.7) shows that the south eastern part of the Site was cleared by this date, although the S.A. Hall building and the building at the rear (north west of the Site) remained. Further to the south on George Street the increasing commercial pressure for development is evident. Small residential properties had been replaced with larger commercial buildings with wider frontages to George Street, altering the medieval burgage plot pattern of narrow frontages.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.16 The 1966-79 edition of the Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.8) shows that the S.A. Hall and the building at the very rear (west) of the Site had been cleared by this time. New development on the Site comprised two separate narrow buildings, the northern of which (no. 70) is rectangular in plan, and the southern (no.72) is of L-shaped plan, extending behind no.70 at its western end. A further L-shaped building occupied the western part of the Site, located against the southern and western boundaries. The redevelopment of the Site led to the formation of a new ginnel running between the Site and the adjacent property of the Bricklayers Arms Public House, and connecting George Street with the yard areas to the rear of these properties. Within the wider area, the map shows the increasing trend of plot amalgamation to create larger scale commercial buildings fronting onto George Street, for example at nos. 74-80 and 88-98 George Street.

Text: Figure 3.8: Ordnance Survey (1966-1979) 1:1,250 Site location marked in red The 1978-1982 map (Figure 3.9) shows the Site to be unchanged. However, change within the wider area, is immediately evident. To the rear (west) of the Site a new road named Central Way had been created running parallel to the earlier roads of George Street and Greenwood Street. This has necessitated the removal of several former smaller buildings. The property to the immediate south of the Site had once more been redeveloped, causing further amalgamation of plots, the new property extending from 74-84 George Street. To the south, a further change in the street pattern was caused by the construction of Grafton Mall. An offshoot of Central Way, aligned approximately north east to south west forms a ramp and bridge vehicle access from Central Way to the first floor of The Grafton Mall, passing over George Street.

Text: 4. Significance of Heritage Assets The NPPF defines the significance of a heritage asset as:

Text: 4. Significance of Heritage Assets “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting”8.

Text: Designated Heritage Assets Designated Heritage Assets

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas 4.2 Conservation areas are “areas of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance.”9

Text: Conservation Areas 4.3

Text: Conservation Areas Historic England has published Good Practice Advice (GPA) on ‘Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment’ to assist in assessing the significance of heritage assets. This guidance has informed the following assessments of significance.

Text: Setting Setting

Text: Setting The NPPF defines the setting of a heritage asset as:

Text: Setting “The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral10.”

Text: Setting 4.5 Historic England has published guidance11 in respect of the setting of heritage assets, providing detail on understanding setting and the associated assessment of the impact of any changes. The guidance confirms at paragraph 9 that setting is not itself a heritage asset or a heritage designation, rather its importance lies in what it contributes to the significance of the relevant heritage asset itself.

Text: Setting 4.6 Further guidance on the definition of setting and how it should be taken into account is set out in national Planning Practice Guidance. In assessing the contribution of setting to the significance of the following identified assets the role of the Site has also been considered.

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.7 The following section considers the special character of the George Street Conservation Area. It is informed by research and site visits, and consideration of the Conservation Area Appraisal12 and associated Conservation Area Management Plan13.

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.8 The George Street Conservation Area covers only the southern part of George Street, to the south of Shaw’s Road and Cross Street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.9 A summary significance statement for the George Street Conservation Area is included in the Conservation Area Management Plan, it states the following:

Text: George Street Conservation Area “The historic value of the George Street Conservation Area is the driving force behind its significance and stems from its long history of urban settlement from the medieval period. George Street formed the spine of the Lower Town, a working class area with a mixture of residential buildings and artisanal workshops. Some of the existing plots still retain their historic medieval burgage plot boundaries. It is notable that the present defining characteristic of the Conservation Area as a retail and commercial hub has continually evolved since the early Victorian period, resulting in the variety of building styles and dates. The survival of some historic ginnels is also significant. Aesthetically, there is substantial scope for improvements as there are a number of visually intrusive and detracting features which have a cumulative negative effect on the significance of the Conservation Area.” (Page 8)

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.10 Key elements of the character and appearance of George Street Conservation Area are as follows:

Text: George Street Conservation Area •

Text: George Street Conservation Area Some existing property boundaries reflect the medieval burgage plots fronting onto George Street. In cases where plots have been amalgamated, ground floor building frontages and fenestration in some cases reflect the historic burgage pattern.

Text: George Street Conservation Area Primary frontages of buildings face onto the primary street of George Street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Buildings within the conservation area are of varying date and architectural style, dating from the Georgian, Victorian and 20th century periods. They reflect the gradual evolution of George Street from a residential street to a commercial high street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Building heights vary, but historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of two or three storeys in height.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of brick with pitched blue slate roofs

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of simple classical style with classical proportions, commonly symmetrical facades and a regular fenestration patterns, and including other classical details such as stone string courses, dentillated eaves, prominent cornices, plain stone cills and multi pane timber sash windows.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Polychromatic brickwork (yellow brick with red brick detailing) is a notable characteristic at first and second storey level, and many buildings on the eastern side of the street include gothic revival detailing (including gable ends fronting onto the street ornamented with bargeboards, pointed arch windows and decorative chimney stacks).

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.12 As described above, Nos. 70 & 72 George Street comprise modern two storey buildings of concrete and brick construction with flat roofs and separate modern retail frontages at ground floor. Both units are a combination of brick panels, large modern window openings (with flanking narrower units at the eaves) and concrete at first floor. No 70 has a small section of tiling between the shopfront and upper windows. Both buildings are assumed to be contemporary (built in c. 1970) and are likely to have been designed and built as a pair of symmetrical commercial buildings. They are no longer consistent. The upper windows of No.72 have been replaced with UPVC units and the ground floor shopfronts are of differing design. A mock Victorian lamp is attached to the frontage of No. 72. To the rear are a series of flat roof modern extensions and facing Central Way is a taller building of mid to late 20th century construction in brick and concrete, on raised concrete pillars and with a shallow pitched roof.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.13 The extant buildings on the Site, fronting George Street, broadly correspond with the general characteristics of George Street, due to their height, brick construction and alignment. They do not however possess the quality of architecture, detailing or materials found on the traditional buildings of George Street, or those that contribute to the character and appearance and townscape of the designated area. Modern flat

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area roofs are not uncommon on George Street (the western side in particular) but they deviate from the pitched roofs of traditional buildings lining the route and do not contribute to a varied roofscape. The existing exposed side elevation of No. 70 is plain, with the exception of vertical brick piers and narrow windows at eaves height.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.14 The existing expression of the two buildings with separate shopfronts corresponds (broadly) with the grain of the historic burgage plots. However, consideration of historic mapping has shown that originally the property at No. 70 George Street was set back from the street line, forming the southern side of an open square (bounded by the Bricklayer’s Arms Public House to the west). Similarly, the ginnel to the immediate north of the Site (between 70 George Street and the Bricklayers Arms Public House) appears to form part of the historic street pattern, but is a recent addition to the area, formed when the current buildings were built in c.1970.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.15 Overall, as viewed from George Street, it is considered that the extant buildings within the Site make a neutral contribution to the Conservation Area.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.16 The Conservation Area Appraisal however notes that the rear of no. 72 George Street makes a negative contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, as viewed from Central Way. Central Way was created in the late 1970s, and is therefore also a modern addition to the conservation area. It would originally have formed backlands to the properties fronting onto George Street. Historic mapping shows that buildings in this area comprised rear additions and ancillary buildings and structures associated with those fronting onto George Street, rather than forming a defined and intentional built edge.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.17 The following section considers the special character of the Old Market Place Conservation Area. It is informed by research and site visits as described above, and through consideration of the Conservation Area Appraisal14 and associated Conservation Area Management Plan15.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.18 The special interest of the Conservation Area lies in the history and development of the area and its market function which is still evident in its streetscene and historic market town character. The Old Market Place Conservation Area Character Appraisal highlights the modest scale and massing of buildings which contribute to that character and create strong building lines along main routes. The appraisal acknowledges that civic buildings in the conservation area tend to be taller.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.20 Central Way was added to the conservation area in 2014 as part of an additional area of land including Shaw’s Road to the north. The reason given for the extension in the Conservation Area Appraisal relates solely to the inclusion of 10 to 22 Shaw’s Road as ‘low key Victorian shops’ that reflect the character of nearby Market Street.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.21 There is no explanation as to why the southern boundary was extended to include Central Way and the only references to the street in the Conservation Area Appraisal relate to the creation of the public square including the Lower Market canopy, the areas of car parking to the north and south of the route and examples of inappropriate boundary treatments.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.22 As described in relation to the George Street Conservation Area, Central Way is a modern route created in the 1970s. The southern part of the route in particular is bounded by areas of car parking, the private rear curtilages of buildings lining Greenwood Street and the rear elevations of buildings lining George Street. These are

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area typically plain, functional or ancillary rear elevations. There is a mix of building forms including pitched roof extensions, standalone buildings and the blank rear elevations and service areas of flat roofed commercial buildings lining George Street, including the Site. The southern part of the street has no coherence. It is an area of disparate and fragmented townscape that lacks the definition and enclosure that is characteristic of many of the other streets within the commercial core of Altrincham.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area It is recognised in the Conservation Area Appraisal that the northern part of Central Way has been enhanced by the introduction of the Lower Market Hall. More recent improvement has been made by the Everyman Cinema and the direct engagement it has with the street.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.24 It is acknowledged in the George Street Conservation Area Appraisal that the rear of no. 72 George Street makes a negative contribution to the character and appearance of the designated area as viewed from Central Way. The same principle applies to the Old Market Place Conservation Area. The raised form of the existing building breaks the building line and it presents in inactive and unattractive elevation to Central Way, whilst recognising that the unit was temporarily enhanced through the addition of food and drink use in 2020.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.1 Under s72(1) of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council, in determining the submitted planning application has statutory duties to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the George Street Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.2 Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.3 Paragraph 199 requires when considering the impact of development on the significance of a designated heritage asset that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation. ‘Conservation’ is defined by the NPPF as ‘the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance.’

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.4 Paragraphs 200 and 201 differentiate between ‘substantial’ and ‘less than substantial harm’ and provide a framework for the consideration of harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, where it arises, bearing in mind the considerable importance and weight that must be given to the statutory duties of the 1990 Act.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.5

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities look for opportunities for new development within the setting of heritage assets to better reveal their significance. It states that proposals that preserve those elements of setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of the asset should be treated favourably.

Text: The Proposed Development 5.9 A three storey building is proposed fronting George Street, containing two retail units at ground floor, with office accommodation above. The proposed building is principally of red multi brickwork with darker brickwork at ground floor. The approach to the façade is continued on the side, north facing elevation, facing The Bricklayers. The two upper floors are of diminishing proportions, delineated by Corten steel string courses and arranged as four window bays. Window units are metal framed and set in stone

Text: The Proposed Development 5.11 A four storey building is proposed in the western part of the Site, addressing Central Way. Commercial (food and drink) use is proposed at ground floor with office accommodation above. The ground floor has large glazed openings in stone surrounds and the upper floors are arranged in four window bays, echoing the proportions and appearance of the George Street façade. The fourth floor is recessed, with a shallow pitched roof, and clad in Corten steel.

Text: Assessment of Impact Assessment of Impact

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.12 By incorporating a mix of retail use and associated shopfronts at ground floor with office accommodation above, the building fronting George Street can, subject to detailing of the proposed shopfronts, reflect and continue the traditional commercial characteristics of the conservation area.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.13 The proposed building, extending to three storeys, is taller than the existing shops. There are however a number of existing buildings of three storeys on George Street and within this part of the conservation area and variety in building heights is characteristic of the designated area due to the broad range of buildings of different ages and styles. Drawings prepared by View Associates show that the proposed building would be of comparable height to 85 to 87 George Street opposite. It is not considered that the increase in building heights from the existing to three storeys would be harmful based on the variety of building heights that already exist on George Street and the contextual approach taken to the design of the building.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.14 To the south of The Bricklayers the existing and adjoining building creates an accumulation of flat roofs in this part of the conservation area. The proposed building will introduce a series of pitched and gabled roof forms that will contribute to a more varied roofscape at the north of the conservation area, in combination with the traditional buildings further north and opposite.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.15 The proposed red brick construction of the proposed building is characteristic of the conservation area and is the prevailing building material on George Street. The diminishing proportions of the upper floors and ratio of solid to void is consistent with nearby historic and traditional buildings, in contrast to the enlarged glazing of the shopfronts. Symmetrical facades with regular fenestration are characteristic of the conservation area and the proposed building follows this approach. Classical details such as string courses and stone cills are also common features. These are applied as contemporary accents to the proposed building.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.16 The existing mid to late 20th century building to the rear of 72 George Street and the area beneath it is described by Trafford Council in the George Street Conservation Area Character Appraisal as ‘particularly intrusive’. It is identified as having potential to be refurbished or redeveloped, subject to new development reflecting the architectural

Text: Assessment of Impact and historic interest of the area, and not having a detrimental effect on the character or appearance of the conservation area. Redevelopment of the Site therefore presents an opportunity for permanent enhancement, bearing in mind the enhancements made to the building during 2020.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.17 By positioning the increased height at the rear of the Site, the broad datum of George Street is maintained and the additional height is experienced from Central Way, where sensitivity is decreased. The height of the proposed building has been markedly reduced during the pre-application process and pitched roof forms have been introduced in response to feedback from Trafford Council. The upper floor has been designed to be both visually recessive, but with a pitched roof form to contribute to the varied roofscape of the conservation area and to echo the profile of the Market House.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.18 The level of enclosure and continuous frontage created by existing buildings along George Street and Greenwood Street, indicates that visual impact is likely to be focussed on south westerly views from the corner of George Street and Cross Street and from Central Way. In this respect it is anticipated that the visual impact of additional height will be localised. The proposed building will not diminish the landmark quality of any key buildings or adversely affect key views from or of the Old Market Place Conservation Area.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.19 It was identified during design development that due to the set back of the Bricklayers Arms, a building of increased height would be clearly visible in combination with the public house (recognised as making a positive contribution to the George Street Conservation Area). Visualisations submitted with the planning application illustrate the way in which the combination of materials, different forms of the proposed buildings and the set back created by the open central courtyard can create a varied backdrop to The Bricklayers in south west views from George Street, whilst ensuring the distinctiveness and prominence of the public house prevails.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.20 In response to guidance within the Conservation Area Management Plan the proposed building design is contemporary but with reference to building materials of both conservation areas and the need for quality. The proposed building fronting Central Way will respect the enclosure and continuous building line in the northern extent of Central Way and will create an active frontage, contributing to enhancement works already undertaken but without disrupting legibility of the street hierarchy due to the order and simplicity of the building façade. The proposed building has similar characteristics to the proposed building fronting George Street but has been simplified to reflect the more informal nature of Central Way.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.21 Although a later addition and dates to the 1970s, the existing ginnel between George Street and Central Way between the public house and the Site reflects the historic street pattern and former connections and the opportunity to re-open this route is positive.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.22 Due to a marked reduction in building heights during the pre-application process, it is not considered that the visual impact created by a building of the height proposed would harm either the George Street or Old Market Place Conservation Areas. The

Text: The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 Case law has confirmed that Parliament’s intention in enacting section 66(1) was that decision makers should give “considerable importance and weight” to the desirability of preserving the special interest and setting of listed buildings, where “preserve” means to “to do no harm”. The presumption is therefore that development proposals should not give rise to harm to the special interest of a listed building. This duty must be borne in mind strongly when considering cases where harm may be considered to accrue, and then the balancing of such harm against public benefits as required by national planning policy.

Text: The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 The same principles apply for conservation areas and the application of s72(1) of the 1990 Act. Whilst the setting of conservation areas is not specifically mentioned in the primary legislation, the NPPF states that the setting of a designated heritage asset can contribute to its significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The National Planning Policy Framework provides a statement of Government planning policies with regard to the protection of all heritage assets. One of the core planning principles of the NPPF is that planning should:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 “conserve heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance, so that they can be enjoyed for their contribution to the quality of life of this and future generations.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Chapter 16 outlines the Government’s guidance regarding conserving and enhancing the historic environment.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 194 outlines the information required to support planning applications affecting heritage assets, stating that applicants should provide a description of the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 197 states that with regard to determining planning applications planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of the heritage assets, and putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 199 confirms that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be. It is also confirmed that significance can be harmed or lost through alteration or destruction of the heritage asset or development within its setting. Any harm to, or loss, of significance of a designated heritage asset should require clear and convincing justification.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 202 is applicable where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset. In these circumstances, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimum viable use.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 206 states that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within the setting of heritage assets to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of a heritage asset should be treated favourably.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 207 identifies that not all elements of a conservation area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution should be treated either as substantial harm under paragraph 201 or less than substantial harm under paragraph 202, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the conservation area as a whole.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Historic England revised its guidance relating to setting and views of heritage assets. The guidance advocates a staged approach to assessment involving identification of the affected assets and setting, an assessment of the degree to which setting and views contribute to the significance of the assets, an assessment of the effects of the proposed development, exploration of ways to maximise enhancement and avoid or minimise harm and the monitoring of outcomes.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The revised guidance clarifies that there is a distinction between views that contribute to heritage significance and views that might be valued for reasons of landscape character or visual amenity. It states that the extent and importance of setting is often expressed by reference to visual considerations. Although views of or from an asset will play an important part, the way in which we experience an asset in its setting is also influenced by other environmental factors

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) such as noise, dust and vibration from other land uses in the vicinity, and by our understanding of the historic relationship between places.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The guidance makes it clear at paragraph 9 that setting is not a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation, rather its importance lies in what it contributes to the significance of the relevant heritage asset itself. The guidance sets out the need for a systematic and staged approach to assessing the impact of development proposals in the setting of a heritage asset. It confirms that such assessment should be based on an understanding of the significance of the heritage assets affected and then the contribution of setting to that significance. Guidance is provided on what potential attributes of setting may or may not make a contribution to the significance of a heritage asset, noting that in any one instance a limited selection of the attributes will be of particular relevance to an asset. These attributes can include:

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The asset’s physical surroundings;

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) • Experience of the asset;

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) An asset’s associative relationships with other heritage assets.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) It is identified that views which contribute more to understanding the significance of a heritage asset include the following:

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) • Those where the composition within the view was a fundamental aspect of the design or function of the heritage asset

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Those where town- or village-scape reveals views with unplanned or unintended beauty

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Those with historic or cultural associations

Text: Executive Summary Executive Summary

Text: Executive Summary This application seeks to transform a central Altrincham site which spans 70-72 George Street and 1 Central Way. It will introduce a vital mixed-use proposal, that will deliver a (currently) under- represented Grade A office experience within the heart of Altrincham town centre, aimed at attracting and securing high skilled Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) looking to upscale from remote working or identify satellite offices outside the City Centre that reduce the need for commuting.

Text: Executive Summary Together with vibrant, flexible floorspace for town centre uses at ground and lower floors the scheme will provide a number of direct and linked economic benefits for the town centre.

Text: Executive Summary Located within a central and sustainable location, the application site is juxtaposed between the popular Market Hall and the key retail frontage of George Street. The application site provides an exciting opportunity to extend the transformation of Central Way and improve connectivity to the main retail element of the town.

Text: Executive Summary The site currently presents as a poor quality, visually intrusive property which detracts from the quality of the George Street Conservation Area. Alongside the contribution to the economy of the Town Centre, the proposal will deliver a significant improvement to the aesthetics of the site, and will deliver a positive legacy project supporting additional jobs to the benefit of the local economy.

Text: Executive Summary The key planning considerations at this site relate to the design response to the individual character of the site, and the associated enhancement of the Conservation Area.

Text: Background to the Proposals Background to the Proposals

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.7. Altrincham Town Centre has seen significant investment over recent years. Following some very difficult years during the global recession, regeneration activity was prompted by the Council’s ‘Altrincham Strategy’ which was published in July 2014. Major projects followed in the form of the Council’s £600,000 investment in the reinvention of Altrincham Market as a unique artisan market; the £19 million transport interchange which reopened in December 2014, and the new Altrincham Hospital which re-opened in April 2015. In more recent times a joint agreement between TMBC and Bruntwood has seen the redevelopment of the former Rackhams store commence and TMBC have also bought Grafton Mall with a view to future redevelopment.

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.8. Public realm works have brought shared space to key areas of the town centre and transformed the appearance and function of key routes. 2019 saw the new £20m Wellbeing Centre open on the site of the former Altrincham Hospital, which included a new £2 million library.

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.9. Projects continue to gather pace with various other commercial and residential schemes ongoing in the town. As the next chapter in the Town’s regeneration, there are emerging proposals for redevelopment of the Grafton Centre (currently a shopping arcade, a Travelodge and other retail units) and work has also commenced on a new residential, commercial, and car park Development at Chapel Square. the

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.10. The proposed development will play its part in this regeneration process, delivering an efficient use of this central brownfield site, and in a location where the redevelopment of the site will offer an improvement to the Conservation Area.

Text: Altrincham Office Market Altrincham Office Market

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.11. The applicant has been working with Altrincham based agents, RPS, who have comprehensive experience facilitating commercial transactions in and around Altrincham.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.12. Underpinning the case for this proposal is the commercial view that there is a very limited supply of smaller suites of Grade A office accommodation within the town centre. This mismatch is evidenced by analysis of supply against the known requirement that was prepared and submitted as part of the pre-application consultation.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.13. As part of this suite of information, a schedule of available supply was prepared is attached at Appendix 1. It confirms that much of the currently available office space is refurbished office spaces, with only three buildings meeting the ‘Grade A’ status, namely Vertex, Air and Chapel Square.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.14. Altrincham based agents RPS identified a need for high quality modern offices within a central town centre location. The lack of readily available office floorspace has resulted in occupiers locating in other centres including Didsbury and Wilmslow. This is reflected in average rents and lease terms, which are comparable with Manchester City Centre.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 7

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.15. To address this imbalance, the proposals are designed to appeal to small professional businesses that want to be based in Altrincham as opposed to the City Centre, and that want to benefit from working in Grade A office space in a market town location. This is particularly desirable in a post Covid market.

Text: Application Site Application Site

Text: Application Site 2.1. Wholly within the administrative area of Trafford Borough Council, the application site area measures c.0.3 ha. The site forms a broadly rectangular shaped block that encompasses 70-72 George Street with a frontage to the southeast through to 1 Central Way which borders the northwest of the building. The site also incorporates a 1970s ginnel which runs along the northern boundary, providing a direct north/south pedestrianised link.

Text: Application Site 2.2. The application site adjoins neighbouring properties to the south, comprising the Everyman Theatre to 74 George Street, which also links through to Central Way. The Bricklayers Arms public house is beyond the 1970s ginnel to the north.

Text: Application Site 2.3. George Street is the principal pedestrianised shopping street in Altrincham Town Centre. It spans from the junction with Regent Road and the Grafton Centre in a north easterly direction as far as the modern shopping centre of the Stamford Building. The site therefore occupies a pivotal location within the Town Centre. Its redevelopment will markedly contribute towards the revitalisation of this evolving part of the Town Centre.

Text: Application Site 2.4. Central Way has historically had a less prominent position but has experienced growth in recent years attributed in part to the success of Altrincham market. It has now benefitted from artisan style operators selling locally sourced product from pagoda style units facing the subject property.

Text: Application Site Figure 1 l View towards the application site from Central Way, prior to inclusion of meanwhile uses.

Text: Application Site 10

Text: Application Site 11

Text: Application Site 2.5. The existing buildings comprise two retail units fronting onto George Street and a temporary ‘pop up’ food and drink outlet fronting onto Central Way. The upper floors of the three-storey building, fronting Central way, are occupied by a martial arts school who pay a nominal rent to reflect the poor condition of the roof and the building generally. At this point the building is two storey in height under a flat roof with the ground floor space being an open void.

Text: Application Site 2.6. As shown opposite, the building is in a poor state of repair and at risk of dereliction. The ‘pop up’ food offer only accommodates the vacant area underneath the building where it fronts Central Way. Prior to this, the building suffered vandalism and antisocial behaviour.

Text: Application Site 2.7. The building’s height rises towards Central Way, which utilises the natural topography of the application site, sloping quite steeply upwards from George Street towards the north/Central Way by approximately 2.5m. Access to the application site can be taken by pedestrians via George Street and vehicle access from Central Way.

Text: Application Site 2.8. The site is within the Environment Agency Flood Zone 1, which is at a low risk of flooding, including from surface water.

Text: Application Site 2.9. There are no trees within the application site, which is wholly occupied by built form and hardstanding.

Text: Application Site Figure 3 l View towards the application site from George Street

Text: Surrounding Area Surrounding Area

Text: Surrounding Area 2.10. The application site is within the George Street Conservation Area and also abuts the Old Market Place Conservation Area to the north (Central Way elevation).

Text: Surrounding Area 2.11. There is no clear local vernacular or building style present in Altrincham Town Centre, or the George Street Conservation Area. The style of architecture in the vicinity is broad comprising a mix of 18th and 19th Century buildings and modern late 20th and early 21st Century commercial premises. Building heights along the street also vary from two storeys up to eight storeys.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.12. The Town Centre location benefits from high levels of accessibility, with access to a wide variety of public and private transport connections. Located within a five minute walk of Altrincham Transport Interchange, the site is highly accessible to the mainline railway, Metrolink and bus services in addition to a cycle hub and therefore has excellent public transport connections to the rest of Trafford, Greater Manchester and the North West.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.13. As part of the Town Centre, the application site plays an important role in the wider Borough, which serves a district population in excess of 210,000. Approximately 410,800 people live within 6 miles of the town centre, extending to 2.3 million people within 12 miles.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.14. Altrincham and the adjacent residential areas of Hale, Hale Barns and Bowdon are particularly popular, due to a combination of excellent educational facilities, good quality housing stock and ready access to excellent shopping and leisure facilities; all within a very short commuting distance of Manchester City Centre.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.15. These characteristics, coupled with the Metrolink, train station, proximity to Manchester Airport, major motorway networks and a high quality independent leisure scene, support our view that the town of Altrincham has the potential to be a leading sub-market for commercial development within South Manchester.

Text: Allocations Allocations

Text: Allocations 2.16. Within the defined town centre, the site is also identified as being within the George Street Conservation Area, which relates to Supplementary Planning Document SPD5.1, Conservation Area Appraisal (2014).

Text: Allocations 2.17. The application site is not listed, nor is it adjacent to any listed buildings, or within the visual context of a listed building. The Bricklayers Arms, which is adjacent to the site, is identified as a positive contributor within the Conservation Area Appraisal, and the accompanying text explains that this annotation identifies a ‘non- designated heritage asset’.

Text: Allocations 2.18. The application site is also identified within the Altrincham Town Centre Neighbourhood Business Plan as being within a ‘Mixed Use with Ground Floor Active Frontages’ allocation.

Text: Allocations 2.19. It is not within any other designations as identified within the Proposals Map.

Text: Planning History Planning History

Text: Planning History 2.20. The Planning History of the site is at Appendix 2. This demonstrates the commercial nature of the site, with advertisement consent sought and applications relating to signage and changes of use over the years.

Text: Planning History 2.21. There are no historic applications relating to the redevelopment of the site available to view online.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.23. The preapplication feedback, which was informed by a meeting and also a written response, confirmed that in principle the redevelopment of the site was acceptable, with key benefits and aesthetic improvements recognised. Detailed comments related predominantly to issues of design and any impact on the Conservation Area.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.24. In response, changes have been made to the design. These are explained in detail within the Design and Access Statement:

Text: Preapplication Consultation • The proposed height has been reduced to provide a three to four storey building, with the design giving the appearance of a three-storey property to both Central Way and George Street.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Additional space has been proposed within a semi-basement area, to deliver the size needed whilst reducing the height above ground and making effective use of the site’s topography.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • The design has also incorporated a stepped back upper level, so that the upper floor will have a reduced visual impact from the street scene to Central Way.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Attention has been paid to the 1970s ginnel, with openings provided to allow for a more active frontage and provide natural surveillance.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.25. In summary, it is considered that the detailed feedback has been considered and acted upon through this submitted proposals to ensure a sensitive design response to this central site.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 14

Text: Preapplication Consultation Proposed

Text: Preapplication Consultation Development

Text: Preapplication Consultation 15

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.1. The proposed development presents the opportunity to redevelop the previously developed site to provide a high-quality intervention befitting its pivotal position within the Town Centre.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.2. In its current form this brownfield site has been a blight on the amenity of Central Way, detracts from the character and appearance of the site, and contributed very little to the local economy, with periods of occupation by short term and temporary uses and vacancy despite being marketed, demonstrating no prospect of occupation in its current form.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.3. Whilst the ground floor to Central Way now has food and beverage uses incorporated, they are not within a permanent structure and therefore, only have a short lease arrangement. This means the benefit they currently provide to the street-scene and vitality of the town centre is not a long-term solution. It does not maximise the site’s potential. The proposal seeks to directly address this with an active and permanent mix of uses appropriate to the site’s central location.

Text: Preapplication Consultation Figure 5 l Proposed visual viewed from Central Way

Text: Preapplication Consultation 16

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.4. The key principles that have underpinned the concept and design approach to the site can be defined as:

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Introduction of high-quality Grade A office accommodation within the Town Centre as part of a mixed-use redevelopment.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Diversification of Altrincham’s commercial offer, providing direct and indirect employment opportunities and increasing activity throughout the week.

Text: Preapplication Consultation Introducing a bespoke and tailored office environment to Altrincham Town Centre aimed at attracting and securing high skilled Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME).

Text: Preapplication Consultation •

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Delivering a highly sustainable commercial building, exceeding the targets set by the current Building Regulations Part L2A.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Creation of an aspirational and attractive, active leisure frontage to Central Way, bolstering the level of activity started by the adjacent Everyman Theatre.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Retention and improvement of pedestrian connectivity between George Street, Central Way and the Market, enhancing the pedestrian experience/ public realm along the 1970s ginnel.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Replacement building of a quality and design to make a positive contribution to the George Street Conservation Area when viewed from Central Way compared to the status quo.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.5. The demolition of the existing buildings will facilitate redevelopment of the site to deliver a new purpose-built building around a central courtyard. the

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Proposed Use and Amount

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.6. The proposal seeks to secure full planning permission for 7,543 sq m (81,192 sqft) gross office space and 5,758 sq.m (61,978 sq ft) gross for flexible use for either retail and/or financial and professional services and/or restaurants and cafes and/or gymnasium or fitness studio (all Use Class E) and/or a drinking establishment (Sui Generis Use Class).

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 17

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Scale

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.7 The submitted plans propose a part three/part four storey building (with the use of the topography to provide a basement floor). This proposed massing has been carefully considered and responds directly to the preapplication feedback from the LPA that the height must be in keeping with the surrounding context. This design approach is considered appropriate, noting the character of George Street, which includes a variety of heights. Specifically, the proposed development will sit lower in height than 85 to 87 George Street opposite the site, and 66 George Street directly to the north.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.6. Within the immediate context, the two and three storey retail frontages are interspersed with taller key/landmark buildings, including the Travel Lodge (8 storeys), The Well Being Centre and Library (4 storeys), Marks and Spencer (3 storeys plus projecting plant area) and Clarendon House, Stamford Quarter (7 storeys).

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.7. The proposed scale and roof shape takes away the height and mass of the accommodation from where it would be viewed from George Street in brief glimpses. There is also a focus to enable much needed visual improvements to the Central Way frontage. The stepped shape to the upper floor further reduces the visual impact of this level.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Figure 7 l Proposed Street Scene – dashed line indicating approximate line of existing buildings opposite.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Figure 8 l Proposed ‘Courtyard’ Elevation

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 19

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.8. The height of the building is considered appropriate in its response to preapplication feedback, and within its visual context. It is sufficiently tall to allow an appropriate quantum of floor space, utilising the natural levels to add a basement level.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Layout

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.9. The layout of the proposed building responds to commercial agency advice and focuses on providing a new “offer” resolving the current mismatch between the existing stock and the requirements for high calibre office occupiers. It also considers the preapplication response to seek to deliver the quality and quantum required within the parameters set by planning policy.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.10. The proposed ground floor layout positively addresses George Street, Central Way with retail or leisure uses to the ground floor and with active use of the 1970s ginnel to the north.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.11. Connectivity and passive surveillance along the pedestrian ginnel forms a key element of the design response to the layout, reflecting application advice. As illustrated by the submitted plans (Elevations 01), the proposed replacement unit will provide windows to the side elevation from George Street, a ramp and staircase to provide access into the unit and the open terraced and naturally landscaped area, and also a large glazed window above glazed pavement lights to Central Way.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.12. This delivers an active frontage towards the Bricklayers Arms to facilitate a welcoming pedestrian connection, and a vast improvement over the existing situation.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.13. At the ground floor frontage to George Street, flexible retail floorspace is proposed which would be capable of occupation by a range of appropriate town centre uses. The layout seeks to maximise its appeal to potential tenants and its contribution to the vibrancy and vitality of the Town Centre.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.14. The unit fronting Central Way is proposed to accommodate a leisure use, with large, glazed windows creating an active frontage and delivering natural light into the unit.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.15. The office accommodation would be accessed separately via a landscaped terraced area within the central section of the building.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.16. Upper floors would be connected around a single central circulation stair and lift core, providing net internal floorplates of 90 sqm – 133 sqm and incorporating WCs (including accessible facilities).

Text: Access Access

Text: Access 3.17. The site is highly accessible and focusses on providing high quality, well designed secure cycle facilities, encouraging active modes of transport for both employees and visitors to the site.

Text: Access 3.18. New car parking spaces are not proposed, reflective of the site’s central and sustainable position. This approach was supported at the preapplication stage, with Highways Officers recognising the wide range of alternative ways of access the site other than the private car.

Text: Access 20

Text: Access 3.19. Whilst there are level changes across the site, level access is achieved to both the ground floor commercial accommodation and access to all upper floors is by passenger lift and staircase with accessible WC facilities provided on each floor. The development will be designed in accordance with the Disability and Discriminations Act and with the current Building Regulations at the time of building.

Text: Landscape and Public Realm Landscape and Public Realm

Text: Landscape and Public Realm 3.20. High quality public realm interventions will ensure increased connectivity and pedestrian footfall along the existing 1970s ginnel, drawing prospective customers through the Town Centre and enlivening a well used connection.

Text: Landscape and Public Realm 3.21. A landscape and public realm scheme for the Central Way frontage and ginnel are submitted (ref Plan (PL)LS01) to ensure there is a synergy with the improvements to the markets and Central Way.

Text: Servicing Servicing

Text: Servicing 3.22. Servicing for units along George Street is currently via Central Way. This arrangement is proposed to remain as existing, but with refuse and re- cycling storage proposed within the ground floor area within the central part of the site allowing for 2 No. 1100L Euro-Bins. These will be accessible via the ginnel to enable access, and are identified within the submitted Waste Management Strategy.

Text: Appearance Appearance

Text: Appearance 3.23. The external appearance of the development has been carefully considered, both in terms of its immediate context and views into the site from surrounding Conservation Areas.

Text: Appearance 3.24. The development seeks to provide a high-quality design and appearance. Contemporary architecture is not discouraged by planning policy, and pastiche design is often resisted in conservation areas. The architectural approach has therefore sought to ensure a balance is struck between providing a confident addition to the street scene and referencing the historic environment through materiality.

Text: Appearance 3.25. The use of an outdoor terrace area introduces a new green space and open area within the central core of the proposed replacement building. This is more in keeping with the area, linking to existing public realm improvements, than the living wall concept presented at the preapplication stage.

Text: Material Palette Material Palette

Text: Material Palette 3.26. The site’s location within the George Street Conservation Area, and abutting the Old Market Conservation Area, has influenced the proposed choice of materials. The Conservation Area Management Plan makes reference to the use of brick within the Conservation Area, with glazed elements evident in numerous locations throughout the locality, and this was reflected in the feedback from the Local Planning Authority at the preapplication stage. This is detailed further within Section 5.

Text: Material Palette 21

Text: Material Palette 3.27. The proposal utilises a hierarchic approach to fenestration, reflective of examples in the vicinity. The glazing will offer generous national light to internal users.

Text: The Development Plan 4.3. Within the adopted Development Plan, the Site is identified as being within the defined Town Centre. It is also within the George Street Conservation Area, which is subject to the provisions of RUDP Policy ENV21. Other relevant Local Development Plan policies can be found in Appendix 3.

Text: The Development Plan 4.4. Work is underway on a replacement Local Plan, with the Regulation 19 consultation expected in Summer 2022. Given the new Local Plan is in the preliminary stages of preparation and has not been scrutinised by an Inspector at an Examination, weight cannot yet be afforded to the draft policies.

Text: The Development Plan 4.5. At the sub-regional level, the draft ‘Places for Everyone’ Plan is not considered relevant to the assessment and determination of the proposals due to the high level nature of the document.

Text: Principle of Development 5.2. The principle of extending and reconfiguring the existing buildings at George Street and Central Way is considered to be acceptable in principle, subject to detailed design and other considerations. These are investigated and assessed within this Chapter.

Text: Principle of Development 5.3. The proposed development directly addresses key objectives of the Core Strategy and the Neighbourhood Plan, including delivering premises that will attract independent retailers providing goods not easily available online, including food.

Text: Principle of Development 5.4. The Neighbourhood Plan identifies that George Street is a ‘mixed use with ground floor active frontage’

Text: Sustainability Sustainability

Text: Sustainability 5.5. Policy L5, Climate Change requires new development to consider how waste can be minimised and sustainability promoted. Sustainability is a cornerstone of the proposed design. The building has been designed to ensure lower carbon emissions than the targets required by the current Building Regulations Part L2A.

Text: Sustainability 5.6. The building will be efficiently designed and follow the “Lean, Clean, Green” hierarchy to maximise the use of daylight and natural resources, minimising energy use and reducing carbon emissions to a minimum.

Text: Sustainability 5.7. The proposed development has been thermally modelled and renewable, low energy, air source heat pumps, efficient heat recovery ventilation systems and controllable daylight dimmed LED lighting is proposed to maintain excellent environmental conditions all year round.

Text: Sustainability 5.8. Water consumption will be minimised with dual flush WC cisterns and other water saving controls. In addition, there will be blue roof technology to attenuate rainwater run off into the mains drainage system.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Heritage Impact Assessment

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.9. The site is within the George Street Conservation Area, and entrance to Central Way also fronts onto Old Market Place Conservation Area. Paragraph 194 of the NPPF requires the decision maker to incorporate an assessment of the impact on both of these designated heritage assets.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.10. Core Strategy Policy R1, Historic Environment, requires new development to be assessed to ensure that any harm to the significance of a heritage asset is considered. This is supported by Saved Policy ENV21, Conservation Areas, which requires new development to preserve and enhance the Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.12 Input from Heritage Consultants Turley since design inception has identified that the buildings in their current form do not benefit the character of the George Street Conservation Area. This is supported by the George Street Conservation Area Appraisal which identifies the site as ‘having potential for enhancement’, specifically identifying the application site fronting onto Central Way. Consequently, the approach to the massing, scale and appearance has been informed by an understanding of the historic significance of the Conservation Areas.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.13 The Heritage Statement confirms that the existing building to the rear of 70-72 George Street and the area beneath it is noted by the Conservation Area Appraisal as being ‘particularly intrusive. It is identified as having potential to be redeveloped, subject to the new development reflecting the architectural and historic interest of the area and not having a detrimental effect on the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.14 The Heritage Statement states that the existing building on the site, whilst being broadly in keeping with the prevalent scale of surrounding properties, is identified as having a neutral impact on the George Street Conservation Area. The impact of that element fronting onto Central Way is also noted as having a neutral impact on the Old Market Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.15 Analysis of historic mapping shows that Central Way was constructed in the 1970s, and it is therefore a modern insertion to the Conservation Area. Buildings on Central Way comprise ad hoc additions and buildings associated with those fronting onto George Street, rather than forming a defined and intentional built edge.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.16 It is also noted that the ginnel at the northern edge of the site is a modern addition, it was formed when the existing buildings, numbers 70 and 72 George Street, were constructed around 1970.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 27

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.17 Redevelopment of the site presents an opportunity for enhancement because the existing building on George Street has been identified to have a neutral contribution to the Conservation Area and facing Central Way the site is identified as a negative element in the street-scene.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.18 Based on the Heritage Statement’s assessment of the significance and the setting of nearby heritage assets, it is concluded that there would be no harm to the identified Conservation Areas. The amendments made following preapplication discussions to reduce the proposed height and massing together with this assessment mean that the Proposed Development will meet the objectives of Paragraphs 197, 199 and 206 of the NPPF and the requirements of s.72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 can be satisfied if Trafford Council grants planning permission.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.19 Moreover, there are benefits that will arise from the proposal to weigh in the planning balance and they are considered to include:

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Introduction of a high quality bespoke building into Altrincham Town Centre.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Delivery of grade A office floorspace.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Job creation.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Removal of an unattractive vacant building on Central Way.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Enhancement of the ginnel to benefit accessibility within the town centre and to reinforce the historic building line.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Introduction of passive surveillance to the town centre.

Text: Design Design

Text: Design 5.20 Saved Policy S6, Development in Altrincham Town Centre requires new development to be of a high quality, with public realm considered as part of the overall proposal. The detail of the design will be assessed against Core Strategy Policy L7, Design, which requires new development to be appropriate within its wider context in terms of scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevational treatment, materials and hard and soft landscaping.

Text: Design 5.21 The full detail of the proposed design is addressed within the submitted Design and Access Statement. In summary, the Applicant has sought preapplication advice and acted positively upon this to amend plans to incorporate feedback. Specifically, the height now proposed is lower in response, and utilises the levels of the site to deliver a design with varied heights, and an open courtyard area to accommodate green space.

Text: Design 5.22 Further changes following preapplication feedback includes the introduction of a courtyard area to provide a landscaped area. This will replace the living wall initially proposed and enables the development to have outside space for future staff and visitors. This area will also incorporate cycle storage spaces.

Text: Design 5.23 The scale and massing of the proposal appropriately responds to the key frontages of George Street and Central Way, with open space providing an interesting frontage to the 1970s ginnel, allowing circulation around the building and retaining pedestrian links.

Text: Design 28

Text: Design 5.24 A key objective of the Altrincham Town Centre Neighbourhood Business Plan is to enable the centre to evolve into an economically, environmentally, and socially attractive and dynamic centre. This is supported through Policy ‘D’ Design and Quality, which requires new development to be of a high quality design, with the scale appropriate to its location and setting. This is emphasised within the National Design Guide (2019) which recognises the flexibility required to deliver vital and viable town centres.

Text: Design 5.25 New proposals must demonstrate how they respond to the Character Areas identified with the Supplementary Design Document. This document identifies the site within the Mixed-Use Historic Area. This identifies materials including brick, red and buff sandstone, terracotta and glazed ceramic, black and white Cheshire vernacular and Welsh blue/grey or Westmorland green slates.

Text: Design 5.26 The Neighbourhood Plan specifically notes that proposals that improve an historic town centre ginnel will be encouraged and supported.

Text: Design 5.27 The submitted Waste Management Plan also prepared by Eden Planning demonstrates that sufficient space it allocated for the storage of waste on site. Space is provided for the separation of recyclables and a clear way, via the ginnel to Central Way where bins can be collected in the same manner as other properties on Central Way.

Text: Amenity Amenity

Text: Amenity 5.28 There are no residential properties in close proximity to the site that need to be taken into consideration by the proposed development.

Text: Landscape and Trees Landscape and Trees

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.29 Policy R3, Green Infrastructure, requires new development to mitigate the effects of climate change and support biodiversity by, for example, including green roofs, walls and tree planting. This is promoted to contribute to the diversification of the local economic and improving health and wellbeing. This Core Strategy Policy is reflected in the Neighbourhood Plan, with Policy G, Green Infrastructure, which also encourages opportunities to enhance all aspects of the public realm.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.30 In response to these policies, the inclusion of a green wall was proposed within the draft design. This was considered inappropriate within the Conservation Area setting and therefore this element of the proposal has been removed from the submitted plans.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.31 To replace this and ensure the proposed development positively responds to Policy R3, the proposal now incorporates a courtyard within which both hard and soft landscaping is proposed, including some tree planting. This is illustrated on the submitted landscaping plans.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.32 There are no trees or existing landscaping within the site as defined by the redline location plan. There are some small immature trees on Central Way but these are either side of the site’s frontage to Central Way and will not be affected by the proposed development.

Text: Landscape and Trees 29

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.33 Considering the current position and the proposed landscaping works within the courtyard the development will increase landscaping to the benefit of biodiversity in accordance with Policy R3.

Text: Archaeology Archaeology

Text: Archaeology 5.34 Core Strategy Policy R1, Historic Environment, requires new development to consider any archaeological impacts, identify the presence or remains of any archaeological significance and manage any finds.

Text: Archaeology 5.35 In response to this policy requirement, an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment is submitted with the application. It concludes that due to the impact of previous development on and around the application site, the potential for significant archaeological remains is low. No mitigation is likely to be required.

Text: Archaeology 5.36 On this basis, the proposed development meets the requirements of Paragraph 194 of the NPPF and Policy R1 of the Local Plan.

Text: Access and Highways Access and Highways

Text: Access and Highways 5.37 Strategic Objection S06, Reduce the Need to Travel, promotes sustainable transport, and this is further supported by CS Policy L4, Sustainable Transport and Accessibility and Saved Policy T10, Transport and Land Use in Town Centres. These policies are also informed by guidance within the SPD3, Parking Standards and Design.

Text: Access and Highways 5.38 Section 9 of the NPPF, Promoting Sustainable Transport, requires development proposals to consider any impacts on transport networks at an early stage, promote walking, cycling and public transport, work with patterns of movement, including existing street layout.

Text: Access and Highways 5.39 Access will remain as existing, with pedestrian access to the George Street elevation, and vehicular access possible from Central Way. The ginnel will be retained, and the design incorporates an active frontage to this pedestrian link.

Text: Access and Highways 5.40 The proposed development is within a highly sustainable location within the defined Principal Town Centre. A Framework Travel Plan prepared by Egg Transport is submitted with the application. This promotes the use of alternative methods of transport over the private car.

Text: Access and Highways 5.41 Preapplication feedback confirmed that the proposed development would not need to provide any car parking provision due to its highly sustainable location. The proposal will include policy compliant cycle parking, 18 hoops are provided within a secure area of the central courtyard.

Text: Access and Highways 30

Text: Noise Noise

Text: Noise 5.42 Policy CS Policy L7 (Design) and Section 12 of the NPPF require new development to be designed to consider the amenity of other users. This includes the potential for the proposal to create any issues with noise.

Text: Noise 5.43 The application is accompanied by a Noise Impact Assessment prepared by Hepworth Acoustics. Based on the assessment’s review of the prevailing conditions, the report identifies a series of recommendations that are fully detailed within the report. These seek to control any noise through control of noise levels, such as avoiding the use of external loudspeakers. Recommendations are also provided in relation to controlling the noise level associated with fixed plant or equipment. Where details of this is not yet known, an acceptable level can be a conditioned.

Text: Noise 5.44 The Assessment notes that there would be no impact from noise break from the premises or the terrace area. The mitigation provides best practicable control of potential noise.

Text: Noise 5.45 With the mitigation in place, the Assessment concludes that the proposed development would not result in any unacceptable harm to residential amenity or noise disturbance.

Text: Ecology Ecology

Text: Ecology 5.46 Policy R2, Natural Environment, requires new development to protect and enhance the landscape character, biodiversity and geodiversity of the Borough. This includes street trees.

Text: Ecology 5.47 The existing site offers little in terms of ecological value. There are currently no trees within the application site, nor is there any green space.

Text: Ecology 5.48 The existing buildings have been assessed as part of a Bat Scoping Study prepared by Kingdom Ecology to assess whether they provide any potential for bat habitat.

Text: Ecology 5.49 The report confirms a lack of suitable habitat within the context of the site, with an absence of trees and vegetation for foraging and brightly lit areas. No evidence of bats was found within the existing buildings, and no roosting features noted. Within this urban context, and due to the character of the buildings themselves, the buildings only offer a negligible bat roost potential. The report also notes that there was no evidence of current or historic nesting bird activity.

Text: Ecology 5.50 No further survey effort or mitigation is proposed. Measures to enhance the site are recommended. These include the provision of swift and sparrow boxes to be incorporated within the design, and small/medium sized nectar rich tree planting.

Text: Ecology 31

Text: Drainage Drainage

Text: Drainage 5.51 Policy L5, Climate Change requires new development to improve water efficiency and reduce surface water run off through Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs).

Text: Drainage 5.52 A Drainage Strategy prepared by Brennan Consult is submitted with the planning application. It confirms that this site is currently served by a private combined water drain along the northern boundary adjacent to the Bricklayers Arms.

Text: Drainage 5.53 The Strategy also assesses the site in terms of its suitability for SUDs, noting which methods could be implemented as part of the proposed development. Geo-cellular Storage is identified as being suitable, with attenuation being introduced beneath the new building. Surface water will pass into the centre of the development, through a flow restricting device. The existing connection to the combined sewer will continue to be utilised, but this will be at restricted rates, which provides betterment over the existing situation.

Text: Drainage 5.54 This will provide betterment in terms of slowing the brownfield surface water runoff, responding to the requirements of Policy L5, Climate Change, and Section 14 of the NPPF.

Text: Planning Benefits Planning Benefits

Text: Planning Benefits 5.55

Text: Planning Benefits 06

Text: Planning Benefits 33

Text: Planning Benefits 6.1. The proposed development incorporates key planning benefits that positively respond to key objectives identified within the Development Plan:

Text: Planning Benefits • Delivery of a modern, high-quality Grade A office development which will help meet the need for this type of accommodation within the heart of Altrincham Town Centre. This will address key occupier requirements for linear configured floorplates, incorporating an enhanced specification and design commensurate with evolving tenant requirements.

Text: Planning Benefits • The high specification office space will be alongside new premises for mixed uses within the lower floors to provide active retail and/or leisure uses to respond to the central location of the site.

Text: Planning Benefits • The design will maximise the use of an underutilised site within Altrincham Town Centre that has been a long-term blight on the amenity of the area.

Text: Planning Benefits • Significantly improved pedestrian experience along Central Way, incorporating enhanced levels of activity, passive surveillance and interaction through an improved facade and high-quality public realm.

Text: Planning Benefits • Opportunities for the retention and improvement of the pedestrian connection between George Street and Central Way by providing high quality improvements to safety and security.

Text: Planning Benefits • Improved relationship with adjacent Everyman Theatre entrance.

Text: Planning Benefits • Increased activity levels within the Town Centre throughout the week with linked benefits for additional spend within local shops and restaurants.

Text: Planning Benefits • Direct employment benefits associated with the proposed office floorspace which will create in the region of 65 FTE jobs.

Text: Planning Benefits • A further indirect financial injection in to the local and regional economy through the construction supply chain. For every £1 spent on construction, demand of £2-£2.81 is generated overall supporting further jobs. Construction has one of the highest economic multipliers, reinforcing the wider regeneration benefits.

Text: Planning Benefits • Based upon benchmark values from similar uses in the immediate area annual business rates contribution in the order of £57,000 per annum. GVA benefit of approximately £3.5m per annum to the Trafford economy. Based upon the current estimated construction cost, approximately 30 construction- related workers could be supported during the development period.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion 07

Text: Conclusion 35

Text: Conclusion 7.1 This Planning Statement provides a description of the proposed development, sets this within the wider policy context, and assesses the proposals against key policy criteria. This demonstrates how the design has responded to policy requirements and preapplication feedback.

Text: Conclusion 7.2 The key planning considerations relate to the principle of the proposed mixed-use building within the Principal Town Centre, and the impact of the development on designated heritage assets. The design and inclusion of positive frontages to promote mixed uses to the ground floor at both George Street and Central Way support the high-grade office space proposed to upper floors, which all are wholly appropriate town centre uses. Further, the submitted Heritage Statement concludes that the design of the proposed development would result in no harm to either the George Street or Old Market Place Conservation Areas.

Text: Conclusion 7.3 The Statement also assesses the design with reference to the Design and Access Statement, noting the references to the Bricklayers Arms adjacent to the site, which is a non-designated heritage asset.

Text: Conclusion 7.4 All other policy considerations relating to trees, ecology, drainage and access are met. For the reasons set out within this statement, it is concluded that the proposed development meets the requirements of the Development Plan and responds to the detail relevant to material considerations. As such, we respectfully request planning permission be granted.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) The Framework (2021) and sets out the Government’s national planning policies for England and how these should be applied. At the core of the Framework is the presumption in favour of sustainable development. The NPPF requires (at paragraph 11) that applications which accord with the development plan be approved without delay. Building a strong, competitive economy Paragraphs 81 - 83 set out the government’s commitment to securing economic growth in order to create jobs and prosperity, placing significant weight on the need to support economic growth through the planning system.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 82 states that planning policies should set out a clear economic vision and strategy which positively and proactively encourages sustainable economic growth and be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, allow for new and flexible working practices and to enable a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances. Ensuring the vitality of town centres

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 86 - 91 seek to promote a positive approach to the growth, management and adaptation of town centres. Local planning authorities are advised to define a network and hierarchy of town centres and promote their long-term vitality and viability – by allowing them to grow and diversify in a way that can respond to rapid changes in the retail and leisure industries, allows a suitable mix of uses and reflects their distinctive characters. Main town centre uses should be located in town centres first, with a sequential approach taken outside of this. The NPPF provides a definition for main town centre uses which includes office development. Promoting healthy and safe communities

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 92 - 93 aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which promote social interaction, for example strong town centres, improved pedestrian connections and active street frontages. Places should be accessible and safe with high quality public space encouraging activity. Promoting sustainable transport

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 104 - 108 encourage development to be focused in locations which are sustainable, limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes. The NPPF clarifies at paragraph 105, that when considering parking standards, LPA’s should take in to account the accessibility of the development and the availability of public transport. Making effective use of land

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 119 - 121 promote an effective use of land and prioritises the use of previously-developed or ‘brownfield’ land. Local authorities should give substantial weight to the value of using suitable brownfield land and promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Achieving well-designed places, Chapter 12 of the NPPF, is important. The creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 46

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) The NPPF states that local Planning policies and decisions should aim to ensure that developments:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) a) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) b) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) c) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change (such as increased densities); d) establish or maintain a strong sense of place, using the arrangement of streets, spaces, building types and materials to create attractive, welcoming and distinctive places to live, work and visit;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) e) optimise the potential of the site to accommodate and sustain an appropriate amount and mix of development (including green and other public space) and support local facilities and transport networks; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) f) create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users49; and where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the quality of life or community cohesion and resilience. (paragraph 130).

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 132 recognises the importance of early discussion between applicants and the local planning authority to inform the evolution of a proposed design.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 194 states that local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 197 states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification (paragraph 200). Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use (paragraph 202).

Text: 1 Introduction 1.1.2 The proposals would provide a mixed-use development comprising leisure/retail units with offices above. The leisure/retail floor units would be accessed off Central Way and would be located on the lower ground and ground floors. The shops, which are existing, are on the ground floor and front onto George Street which forms the eastern boundary of the site. The offices would be located on the upper floors of the building and would be accessed via a lane running between Central Way and George Street.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 1.1.3 This Framework Travel Plan (FTP) is an accompanying document to the planning application and has been produced to set out key parameters that relate to implementation of the full Travel Plan (TP) that will be in place once the development is occupied. The full TP will promote a series of targeted measures that will aim to encourage visitors to the site to use sustainable travel instead of making single-occupancy car trips.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 1.1.4 Agreement is sought on the parameters of the Full Travel Plan with the Local Planning Authority (LPA) and Local Highway Authority (LHA) which is Trafford Council (TC).

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1 Background to Travel Plans

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.1 A TP is a package of practical measures that aims to reducing the traffic impacts of a development. The main objective of a TP is usually to reduce single occupancy car trips whilst simultaneously encouraging travel via sustainable modes of transport.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.2 The DfT’s document ‘Making Residential Travel Plans Work’ (June 2007) introduces the concept of a ‘Travel Plan Pyramid’. This helps demonstrate how successful plans are built on the firm foundations of a good location and site design. The pyramid is presented in Figure 2.1.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context Figure

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context Source: Making Residential Travel Plans Work, Department for Transport, 2007

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.3 The use of a pyramid structure to illustrate the 5-tier hierarchy of measures demonstrates the concept that each higher layer builds upon the more important foundations of criteria and initiatives below it.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.4 The most important layer of the pyramid is considered to be the base, which shows the key to making TPs work is the actual location of the development and its proximity to local facilities and services.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.5

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context In terms of location, the site is within Altrincham town centre and so is close to a wide range of local amenities and facilitates. It is also within walking and cycling distance of residential areas which makes it feasible for visitors and staff to travel to the site via of foot and by bike.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context www.eggtransport.co.uk

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk www.eggtransport.co.uk

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk page 3

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.6 The second layer of the pyramid refers to how the layout of the site can assist in reducing the need to travel, which in this instance is again linked to the existing layout which includes cycle parking. Additionally, the proximity of bus routes, the Metrolink, rail connections and local pedestrian and cycle infrastructure provides access to a range of key amenities and employment destinations.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.7 As indicated in Level 3 of the pyramid, the Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC) will be able to develop further measures to maximise the sustainable travel at the development.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.8 Level 4 of the pyramid looks at how parking management and public transport can influence travel choice.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.9 The top layer of the pyramid relates to how the TP will be marketed and how the measures within are to be promoted.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.10 Future users of the proposed development will be made aware of the aims of the TP and will be informed of sustainable travel choices that are available. Additionally, public transport information will be displayed in any reception areas, where appropriate.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.2 Objectives of the Plan

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.2.1 The key objectives of this TP are to:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • minimise single occupancy car trips;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • promote car sharing, walking, cycling and public transport as safe, efficient, affordable alternatives to private car; and

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • highlight the health and environmental benefits of using sustainable travel modes.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.3 Benefits of the Plan

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.3.1 A large number of benefits could be derived from the successful implementation of the TP, for future visitors to the site as well as the wider community. These include:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk improved health and fitness through increased levels of walking and cycling;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk increased flexibility offered through wider travel choices;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk the social aspects of sharing transport with others; and

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • improvements to the environment surrounding the site as vehicular movements are minimised and parking pressures are reduced.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4 Targets

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.1 Targets are the measurable goals by which the progress of the TP would be assessed. Targets are essential for monitoring the progress and success of the TP, and should be ‘SMART’ – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-related.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.2 Targets come in two forms. ‘Action’ type targets are non-quantifiable actions that need to be achieved by a certain time, while ‘Aim’ type targets are quantifiable and generally relate to the degree of modal shift the TP is seeking to achieve.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.3 Action targets include actions such as appointing a TPC, and launching the TP.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.4 The ‘aim’ targets contained in the TP focus on minimising the proportion of trips made to and from the site by single occupancy vehicles while encouraging the use of sustainable travel modes.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.5 The TP targets should therefore aim to achieve a realistic and feasible reduction in car driver trips over the first 5 years from when the development is occupied, with a full review scheduled 5 years thereafter.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5 Initial Travel Research

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.1

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research In order to set targets to reduce the reliance on private car travel and increase the use of sustainable modes, the travel behaviour of visitors to the site at the start of the TP will be collected once the site is fully occupied.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.2 Without this initial baseline data, the modal split of the workplace population has been forecast using census dataset (WP703EW - Method of travel to work (Workplace population) for the census area ‘Trafford 025’ in which the development is situated. The modal split of people who work in this area is shown in Table 2.1.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research Table 2.1 – Modal Split of Commuting Trips

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research Mode Modal Split Public Transport 16% Car Driver or Motorcycle 64% Car Passenger or Taxi 6% Bicycle 3% On Foot 11% Total 100%

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.3 The census data presented in Table 2.1 gives an initial indication of commuting patterns at the site prior to the initial travel surveys being carried out and without the influence of TP measures. It shows that 36% or people working in the area around the site use sustainable travel modes such as public transport, cycling, walking or car sharing.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.5 The figures in Table 2.2 are indicative only and would be considered fully when travel surveys have been undertaken.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk have been undertaken.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.6 Once the site is fully occupied, employees would be surveyed, and targets produced. Once the development is occupied, sustainable travel initiatives (such as those described in section 4) would be implemented.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.7 It would take time for the effects of the possible initiatives to occur. During the time between the initial survey and the second survey, sufficient time should have passed for a shift in travel patterns to occur.

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.1 Introduction

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.1.1 This section of the report examines the accessibility of the site by sustainable travel modes and considers the following:

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity • Walking and Cycling

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity • Public Transport

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.2 Walking and Cycling

Text: Walking Walking

Text: Walking 3.2.1 The Institute for Highways and Transportation (IHT) publication ‘Guidelines for Providing for Journeys on Foot’ (2000) provides suggested walking distances to some common facilities, which may be used for development planning purposes. The document recognises that the preferred maximum walking distance for commuting trips is 2km.

Text: Walking 3.2.2 This document goes on to state that “walking accounts for over a quarter of all journeys and four fifths of journeys of less than one mile” (Paragraph 1.12, Page 11). In other words, around 80% of trips of less than 1 mile are made on foot.

Text: Walking 3.2.3 The site is located within Altrincham town centre but benefits from also being close to significant residential areas with very good pedestrian facilities. It is possible to walk to the site from most of Altrincham as well as from parts of neighbouring areas such as Timperley, Hale and Bowden.

Text: Cycling Cycling

Text: Cycling 3.2.4

Text: Cycling It is generally accepted that cycling has the greatest potential to substitute for short car trips, particularly those less than 5km. A large amount of residential development is located within 5km of the site which means that staff and visitors to the development could cycle to the site.

Text: Cycling 3.2.5 A 5km cycle distance from the site includes all of Altrincham, Hale, Timperley, Hale Barns and parts of Sale. The topography of the area is fairly flat and there is a vast network of lightly trafficked residential streets in the surrounding environment, most of which are subject to a 30mph speed limit which makes for an attractive environment for cycling.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.1 The site is located around 250m from Altrincham public transport interchange on Stamford New Road (A538). These stops provide frequent services to a wide range of destinations including, Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Wythenshaw, Stockport, Warrington and Knutsford.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.2 The interchange also includes connectivity to the Metrolink network and rail connections with direct rail services to Manchester Piccadilly station and Chester.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.3 It is feasible for staff and visitors to the site to travel on foot, on a bike. The site is also considered to be well placed in terms of public transport connectivity.

Text: 4 Measures 4 Measures

Text: 4 Measures 4.1 Introduction

Text: 4 Measures Implementation of the TP will require the following commitments, as a starting point:

Text: 4 Measures • appoint a Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC);

Text: 4 Measures • undertake travel surveys; and

Text: 4 Measures implement suitable measures.

Text: 4 Measures 4.2 Travel Plan Coordinators

Text: 4 Measures 4.2.1

Text: 4 Measures It is envisaged that a single TPC would be appointed to coordinate the implementation of the Travel Plan across for all users of the site. The TPC will act as a liaison point for any issues relating to the TP and will be responsible for developing the final TPs, which will be brought into action within 3 months of the first staff surveys.

Text: 4 Measures In terms of the roles and responsibilities, the TPC will be expected to:

Text: 4 Measures • administer/manage the TP and implement the plans with TC;

Text: 4 Measures • ensure travel awareness amongst staff;

Text: 4 Measures coordinate the travel surveys; and

Text: 4 Measures • promote and encourage the use of travel modes other than the car and car-sharing, where appropriate; and

Text: 4 Measures • ensure that all staff are made aware of the existence of the TP and its aims.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3 Travel Surveys

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.1 The first step to developing the operational TP is to establish how the patients make journeys to and from the site.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.2 A travel survey for staff based at the development will be conducted initially and then every two years thereafter as part of the monitoring and review process. The surveys will be performed in order to ascertain existing ‘baseline’ travel from which to measure changes in travel as a result of the TP.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.3 The travel survey will be used to show how people travel to the site, what potential there is for change (for example, the numbers of people who would like to walk, cycle or use public transport, but are unable to do so), what are the most significant deterrents to using sustainable transport and what would encourage people to reduce car use. The following information can be obtained:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • how site users usually travel to and from the site;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • where site users are generally travelling to/from;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • if any places within the site are considered to be dangerous for walking or cycling, and why;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • how users of the site would like to travel if they had the choice and;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • whether they own a bicycle or have a travel pass for public transport.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.3.4 The full TP will be submitted to the LPA and LHA within 3 months of the first surveys.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.4 Potential Measures

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.4.1 The results of the travel surveys would be used to identify measures that would be effective in encouraging sustainable travel. The following is a list of measures that may be suitable for the proposed development:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • agreeing to set up a ‘Cycle to work’ scheme whereby the costs of buying a bike is paid for through instalments and taken from employee salaries before taxation;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk issuing of personal safety alarms to staff;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • provision of lockers for people wishing to walk, run or cycle;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • a guaranteed taxi home for people working late who may have walked or cycled to the site;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk funding of passes for public transport.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1 Introduction

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1.1 The monitoring and review programme will be designed to generate information which will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the TPs, revise measures and refine the plan over a 5- year period.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1.2 On completion of the first travel survey, it will be appropriate to set targets which seek to achieve an increased proportion of residents travelling by sustainable forms of transport.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2 Monitoring

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2.1 Monitoring would include items such as:

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring • establishing travel habits / modal split; and

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring • general feedback from staff, including identifying any barriers to using sustainable travel modes.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2.2

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring Information gathered as part of the continuous monitoring process would be made available to TC. Through this medium, future strategies for further TP objectives can be considered in partnership between the occupiers of the site and TC.
