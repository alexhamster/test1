Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.0 Proposal

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.1 The house currently has an attached garage on the eastern side, with a snug above it at first floor level. The proposal is for a two-storey side extension in front of this. The

Text: 4.0 Proposal building line at the side of the extension will match the existing building line at the side of the garage. The building line at the front will be set back from the main property.

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.2 The extension will join up with the existing garage/snug to create a private amenity space for a gym, allow garage parking space for 2 cars and provide habitable living accommodation on the first floor.

Text: 4.0 Proposal The front and rear elevations will have dark grey timber windows, with black gutters and downpipes to replicate the existing house. The existing dark grey metal garage doors will be replicated in a relocated position at the front of the extension. There will be a black-painted timber fascia. The eastern elevation will have brickwork matching the existing house. The rear will have dark grey aluminium New Wave style doors.

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.3

Text: 4.0 Proposal 4.4 The roof will be a crown roof with a roof window on the flat top section. The roof tiles will be dark grey to match the existing house.

Text: 4.0 Proposal No changes are proposed to access or parking.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.0 National planning policy

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.1

Text: 5.0 National planning policy The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2021) is a material consideration in any development proposals. The principle thread running through the NPPF is the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Para. 11 states that proposals which accord with the development plan should be approved.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.2 Para. 130 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments meet certain requirements, including that they:

Text: 5.0 National planning policy a) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;

Text: 5.0 National planning policy b) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;

Text: 5.0 National planning policy c) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.3 The proposal meets these requirements because it will function well, improving amenity at the property. It has been well designed and will be visually attractive, and materials will match the existing property.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.4 Para. 130 goes on to state that developments should provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. The proposal will improve amenity for the

Text: 5.0 National planning policy occupiers. There will not be any adverse impact on the amenity of neighbours, due to the appropriate scale of the proposed building.

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.5 With regard to heritage assets, the NPPF states the following (para. 195):

Text: 5.0 National planning policy “Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal.”

Text: 5.0 National planning policy 5.6

Text: 5.0 National planning policy Para. 201 states that proposals that will result in loss of or substantial harm to a heritage asset should not usually be permitted. Para. 202 states that:

Text: 5.0 National planning policy “Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.”

Text: 5.0 National planning policy The proposed works comply with the NPPF because the heritage assets (the conservation area and nearby listed group of buildings) will not be harmed. This is discussed in the next section.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Trafford Core Strategy (2012)

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Policy L7 of the Core Strategy states that with regard to design, development must:

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Be appropriate in its context

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Make best use of opportunities to improve the character and quality of an area

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) • Enhance the street scene or character of the area by appropriately addressing scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevation treatment, materials, hard and soft landscaping works, boundary treatment;

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) Policy R1 of the Core Strategy requires all new development to take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness. Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.2

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.3 The proposal accords with these policies; it is a proposal for a modest extension, which will be built using materials to match the existing house. It will not impact on- street parking levels.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.4 Policy L7 of the Core Strategy states that development must not prejudice the amenity of future occupiers of the development and/or occupants of adjacent properties by reason of overbearing, overshadowing, overlooking, visual intrusion, noise or disturbance, odour or in any other way.

Text: Trafford Core Strategy (2012) 6.5 The proposal accords with this policy because it will improve amenity at the property for the occupiers. It will not impact adjacent properties as it will be well screened by landscaping, and it is for private use.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016)

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) 6.6 The building is not identified as a "positive contributor" to the Conservation Area. The following policies are of relevance:

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 14

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) If the replacement of doors or windows is proposed, whether the existing is of timber or uPVC, any further replacements should be in timber and should represent a significant improvement over the existing. Where windows are replaced, they should respect the size and form of the original opening(s) and glazing bars, and be of an appropriate traditional design. Replacement doors and windows should not detract from the established character of the building.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 16

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Roof lights should not to be installed in locations that impact on the aesthetic value of the principal elevation or streetscape and should not be disproportionately large compared to the established fenestration. Conservation roof lights should be installed rather than standard roof lights.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 18

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Established architectural detailing and features are not to be removed or replaced, unless on a like-for-like basis. All replacement features should conform to the original design of the property, as described in the design guidance above.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 49

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Any new development should be of high quality and should take inspiration from the established architectural styles within the Conservation Area.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 50

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) Extension of an existing building should have regard to its established style by echoing the building’s established features, form, proportions and materials.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) • Policy 51

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) The scale of any new development should mirror the existing building and plot sizes.

Text: Devisdale Conservation Area Management Plan (2016) The proposal is in accordance with all these requirements.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.0 Heritage Assessment

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.1 The property is located within the Devisdale Conservation Area and is close to the Grade II listed group of houses; Suffolk House, Bradgate and Holmacre. Both the conservation area and the listed buildings are heritage assets.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.2 In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2021) we are required to describe the significance of the heritage assets.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.3

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment To assess significance, the guidance provided in Historic England’s Good Practice Advice in Planning 2 (Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment) has been followed.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.4

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment The Devisdale Conservation Area Appraisal identifies that the application site is within the Character Zone A: Northern Residential. This character zone is comprised of residential properties from the Victorian, Edwardian post war and mid-20th to early 21st centuries. There are a variety of architectural styles, scale, massing and plot sizes throughout the area. The character of this zone is one of an affluent residential suburb. Some areas feel more secluded than others due to the properties being set back from the street, but the prevalence of low stone walls with mature planting above unifies the entire zone.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.5 The significance of the heritage asset therefore comes from its architecture and layout.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.6

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment The Grade II listed group of houses - Suffolk House, Bradgate, Holmacre - is located on the opposite side of Harrington Road. They were first listed in July 1985. The list entry (1067963) describes them as follows:

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment “Includes Holmacre and Bradgate, Harrington Road. House, now three houses. c.1860. Yellow and pink brick used to give polychromatic effect; slate roof. Large 2- storey house (plus basement and attic) in an Italianate style which has a slightly later wing to the east and some C20 alterations both of which are in keeping. 6-bay house with 3-bay addition. Projecting brick plinth, stone bands, striated patterned and zig- zag brickwork, timber bracketed eaves, hipped roofs and several decorative chimney stacks. 2-storey canted bay window in bays 1 to 3. Elaborate timber porch to bay 5. Bays 5 and 6 are set back but given emphasis by a tall mansard roof with dormer window. All windows are sashes with either semicircular, segmental or flat arched heads in coloured brick. The jambs use ovolo-moulded bricks and in some cases form pilasters with moulded stone capitals. Several first floor windows have small stone

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment balconies with cast iron railings. Left elevation has small central pediment; the rear, a 3-arch recessed loggia (now door to Holmacre) and a projecting bay, canted at first floor level.”

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.7 The significance of the group of listed buildings therefore derives from design and detailing.

Text: 7.0 Heritage Assessment 7.8 The proposal will not cause any harm to the heritage assets. The proposed extension will match the main house in style and materials. It will be lower than the main part of the house and will be set back from the front building line.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.0 Summary

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.1 The site is located on the northern side of Harrington Road in Altrincham. It is occupied by a modern two-storey detached dwelling and is surrounded by similar low density residential development.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.2 The site is located in the Devisdale Conservation Area and immediately to the south- west of the site, on the opposite side of Harrington Road is a Grade II listed group of houses; Suffolk House, Bradgate and Holmacre.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.3 The proposal is for a two-storey side extension. It will match the main house in style and materials. It will be lower than the main part of the house and will be set back from the front building line.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.4 The extension will improve amenity at the property. There will be no adverse impacts on neighbours due to the sensitive design of the proposal.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.5 The proposal will not cause any harm to either the conservation area or the setting of the listed buildings.

Text: 8.0 Summary 8.6 The proposal complies with national and local planning policy and should therefore be approved.
