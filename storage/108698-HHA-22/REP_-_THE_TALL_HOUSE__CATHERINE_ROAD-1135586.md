Text: Comment Details Dear Ms Chau

Text: Comment Details Reference Planning Application number - 108698/HHA/22

Text: Comment Details Location - Bartomley, Catherine Road, Bowdon, WA14 2TD

Text: Comment Details We write with regard to the above mentioned planning application. Prior to the application being determined we would like a planning officer from Trafford Council to visit our property.

Text: Comment Details We have noticed that the visible area of the proposed tiled roof is approximately 5 times the size of the current visible area and extends much closer to our property. This will affect light entering our property and will be visually detrimental from certain locations.

Text: Comment Details Once an officer has visited then the Planning Authority will be in possession of all the relevant information required in order to determine the application.

Text: Comment Details Yours sincerely
