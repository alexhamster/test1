Text: Site Context 2. The Site

Text: Site Context 2.1. The application site is located within the field to the south of the dwelling at 299 Ashley Road.

Text: Site Context 2.2. The wider site (299 Ashley Road) is located on the edge of the settlement of Hale, accessed from Ashley Road and bounded by large detached dwellings to the north and the alignment of the Manchester-Chester railway line.

Text: Site Context 2.3. The property transitions from the northern urban development moving south through the formal garden and pond to the rural southern field where the application site lies.

Text: Site Context 2.4. A shared driveway provides access to no’s 295, 297 and 299 Ashley Road (as approved ref. H/48731). The shared access is grass-crete construction leading from Ashley Road to the main entrance gate at no.299 Ashley Road.

Text: Site Context 2.5. There is currently a temporary construction access on site as approved within the original replacement dwelling permission, reference 97561/FUL/19. The construction access was permitted to mitigate potential damage and disturbance along the shared access and to support the increase of construction vehicles on site.

Text: Site Context 2.6. The application site wholly covers the construction access which is located within the Green Belt and open countryside.

Text: Planning History Planning History

Text: Planning History 2.7. The land within the application site forms part of the property at 299 Ashley and has been subject to Full Planning permission for a replacement dwelling and since been subject to several amendments and discharge of conditions, including a Section 73 application, reference 102088/VAR/20, approved in May 2021.

Text: Planning History 2.8. As mentioned, a temporary construction access was permitted under ref. 97561/FUL/19 with a condition which required the temporary access to be closed and restored prior to occupation of the replacement dwelling.

Text: Planning History 2.9. A subsequent non material amendment application was approved in May 2022 to extend the presence of the construction access road until December 2022 to enable the occupiers to move into the property whilst construction work continues.

Text: Planning History 2.10. In parallel with this application, a further non material amendment application has been submitted for tweaks to the alignment of fencing and gates. The non material amendment proposes to reposition the field gate to the southern field to a more suitable location and would remain unchanged/in the same position in this application if considered acceptable.

Text: Proposed Development Proposed Development

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3. Proposed Development

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.1. This application seeks permission for engineering operations within the southern field of the property. The new private way will serve as a new access for the detached dwelling at 299 Ashley Road.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.2. The private way will be connected to the existing shared entrance where it leads from Ashley Road and will follow the existing construction access layout up to the main entrance gates of 299 Ashley Road.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.3. The construction access currently comprises gravel which will be reused where possible with a central grass verge planted. Photographs of similar designs are illustrated on the supporting Proposed Site Plan, reference 17237 (PL) 060 Rev C and in Figure 1 opposite.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.4. On completion of the new private way, the use of the shared access between 297 Ashley Road and the main entrance of 299 Ashley Road will be retained as a secondary access should that be needed.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.5. The need for this access has stemmed from the need to enhance security across the site (details provided to officers under separate cover), but delivers additional benefits as outlined in this report, included to neighbours in the form of enhanced appearance/outlook and amenity.

Text: Planning Assessment 5. Planning Assessment

Text: Planning Assessment 5.1. The Development Plan is the starting point for decision making as required by Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Proposals that accord with an up-to-date Development Plan should be granted without delay.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.2. The creation of a private way will provide a new access to be used by the occupiers of no.299 Ashley Road and for visitors and deliveries to the site.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.3. The functionality of the private way will be twofold, providing access to the southern rural field for maintenance as well as access to the property to the north.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.4. Paragraph 150 within the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) identifies engineering operations to not be inappropriate development in the Green Belt provided they preserve its openness.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.5. The test is therefore whether the private way impact openness. To address this the drawings demonstrate the private way would be designed to appear as a rural-like track with a central grass verge without formal edging or kerbs. The private way will blend into the landscape once the grass verge is matured and will not be visible from the surrounding areas.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.6. The mature belt of vegetation that follows the River Bollin screens views from the south. Similarly, views from the north and west will

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location be predominantly screened by mature vegetation and housing and the railway line will screen views from the east.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.7. A similar proposal nearby (Mobberley - albeit Cheshire East) for an additional access drive within the Green Belt at Owen House Farm, reference 14/1516M was allowed at appeal. The Inspector agreed and confirmed the engineering works are not inappropriate and would preserve the openness of the Green Belt. The Inspector noted specifically that the central grass strip would assist helping the private way to blend into the open countryside/landscape. As such, the Inspector considered the proposal would not be inappropriate development in the Green Belt and granted planning permission.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.8. We consider the proposed engineering works are considered appropriate in the Green Belt and will not impact the openness of the Green Belt due to the modest nature and careful design to integrate the proposal into the landscape. The proposal is in accordance with Core Strategy policy R4, ‘saved’ UDP policy C4 and the Framework.

Text: Appropriate Design Appropriate Design

Text: Appropriate Design 5.9. The proposed private way has been designed to resemble a rural track with a central grass verge.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.10. The grass verge has been included within the design to enhance biodiversity and to sensitively implement the private way into the rural southern field.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.11. The private way will utilise the current construction access to provide formal vehicle access to the southern rural field and to the

Text: Appropriate Design 12

Text: Appropriate Design main entrance gate of the property for the occupier, visitors, maintenance, and delivery drivers.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.12. The way has been designed to follow the alignment of the temporary construction access but to considerably reduce its width and the amount of hardstanding, implementing soft landscaping to minimise its visibility. The private way will follow the temporary construction access to utilise works that have already taken place, sustainably reusing material wherever possible.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.13. As mentioned, Appeal decision for Cheshire East application 14/1516M for an access drive was considered by the Inspector to not be urbanising or unduly harmful to the rural landscape. Similar, this current proposal for a new private way has been designed to sympathetically blend into the rural landscape and incorporates a central grass verge which will not be urbanising and will be appropriate in the rural location.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.14. The private way will have a sympathetic design and is in accordance with Core Strategy Policy L7, R2 and R4, and ‘saved’ UDP policies C4 and ENV17.

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations Wider Benefits and Considerations

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations 5.15. Engineering works within the Green Belt are not considered inappropriate development where it does not adversely impact the openness of the Green Belt, as such we do not consider that Very Special Circumstance are required.

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations 5.16. However, if officers take a different view, Very Special Circumstances exist in the form of the need for improved security, impact to mature trees and impact to the amenity of neighbouring residents.

Text: Security Security

Text: Security 5.17. A separate letter is submitted to provide a robust justification for the need to improve security on site. We kindly request that these letters remain strictly private and confidential and are only viewed internal to inform the Planning Officers’ assessment.

Text: Security 5.18. The requirements and justification outlined in the attached letters in our view remain relevant should the occupier change.

Text: Trees Trees

Text: Trees 5.19. The proposal will not impact any of the existing and approved vegetation and landscaping, as permitted by reference 106614/CND/21.

Text: Trees 5.20. The supporting Veteran & Ancient Tree Report prepared by Chris Allen Cert Arb, a Professional Tree Inspector undertook an assessment of the mature trees located adjacent to the shared access have been identified as an ancient Oak (T1), veteran Oak (T2), and a future veteran Oak (T3).

Text: Trees 13

Text: Trees 5.21. The report highlights T3 lies outside of the application site, however due to its potential to become a veteran, it should be included in the consideration of mitigation and protection.

Text: Trees 5.22. To protect the vitality of the trees, the report concludes the temporary construction access has provided a one-off opportunity to consider the implementation of a new access which will alleviate compaction and root restricting issues of the trees.

Text: Trees 5.23. The occupier and visitors will cease to use the shared access on a regular basis once the private way is implemented which will lessen the usage of the shared access, supporting the longevity of the veteran and ancient trees.

Text: Trees 5.24. If Very Special Circumstances are applied to the assessment of the proposed private way, it is considered that the new access will have the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of the veteran trees and will not impact any trees on site.

Text: Trees 5.25. The proposal is in accordance with Paragraph 174 of the Framework, Core Strategy Policy R2 and ‘saved’ UDP Policy ENV13.

Text: Living Conditions and Amenity Living Conditions and Amenity

Text: Living Conditions and Amenity 5.26. The proposed private way will be located away from the existing shared access. As an additional benefit, the new access will mitigate any disturbance caused from vehicular movements by the occupiers, visitors, deliveries and night time security checks, improving neighbouring amenity in accordance with Core Strategy Policy L7.

Text: Flood Risk Flood Risk

Text: Flood Risk 5.27. In accordance with ‘saved’ UDP policy ENV13, the private way will not alter the existing levels on site and will be wholly permeable. As such, the private way will not increase the risk of flooding on site and its surrounds.

Text: Summary Summary

Text: Summary 6. Summary

Text: Summary 6.1. This application proposes to introduce a private way connecting two existing access points to serve the replacement dwelling permitted in 2019 at 299 Ashley Road, Hale.

Text: Summary 6.2. The works proposed comprise engineering operations which are not inappropriate in the Green Belt.

Text: Summary 6.3. We have demonstrated that the openness of the Green Belt will be preserved and provide a relevant Inspectors decision where a similar conclusion was reached. The design of the private way as a rural track is entirely in keeping with the character of this part of the site.

Text: Summary 6.4. We have assessed the proposal against the planning policy tests and consider there is no harm, rather, it delivers improvements and represents sustainable development.

Text: Summary 6.5. We trust this application provides sufficient information to register and progress this application and we look forward to your support for these proposals. We appreciate that the Council have an extensive workload therefore if you have any queries or need information to assist with the consideration of this application, please do not hesitate to contact us.
