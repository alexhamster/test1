Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |:

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: The aim of the guidelines is to allow for the varied display and advertising requirements of individual shops. To achieve this without the numerous different styles looking chaotic when viewed together, some simple limits are required. Figure 2 shows this diagrammatically.

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: Acceptable signage / display area shown shaded)

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: The main features are that the signage/display area should be:-

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: (a) Not too high. The top should be below the level of the bottom of the first floor windows, and not above the tops of neighbouring fascias. If the fascia sign is-too high it will look too large and over-dominant.

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: (b) Not too wide. It should leave space for a pilaster or part of the building structure at each side between it and next door. This separation helps different shop fronts and signs next to each other to look well because they are set within a framework. It helps the shop front to relate better to the rest of the building above as the pilasters provide visual support and continuity.

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: am)

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: (c) Not too low. A solid base (“'staliriser") of at least 450mm (ft 6in) should be provided. This helps to make the shop front relate better to the rest of the building by providing a visual base (see Section 9 for further details).

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: (d) Not too far forward. Box or fascia signs should not project forward of the pillar or pilaster at the side. Ready made boxed signs bolted on to the front of the fascia often look crude and obscure the visual effects of the side pillars or pilasters. Shop front design and construction should allow for signs and security shutter boxes to be accommodated without coming forward of the pilasters.

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: (e) Not too small or non-existent. Non-shop uses such as banks, betting shops and restaurants and even some shops may not require a large display area but if they are in a shopping frontage they should provide at least some glazing or display, in order to appear appropriate and to add to the vitality of the shopping area in which they are situated.

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: Fig. 3

Text: ACCEPTABLE SIGNAGE/DISPLAY AREA |: Fascia sign should be in plane with the window {left} rather than coming forward of the pilaster (right)

Text: DESIGN DESIGN

Text: DESIGN 3.1 The design should have regard to the appearance of the rest of the building. Identical frontage treatment should not be extended across buildings of different characters. Display window treatment should not clash with upper floor window styles. (Possibilities are to have a similar style, to go for simplicity, or to create similar proportions by appropriate subdivision) main display window vertical subdivisions should match the pattern of solid to window on the upper floor.

Text: DESIGN 3.2 For small shop fronts simplicity can work better than a complicated arrangement of glazing subdivisions. For larger shop fronts a very wide undivided expanse of glazing usually looks awkward and some vertical subdivision is advisable.

Text: DESIGN 3.3 Plain shop fronts can look appropriate in plain modern buildings but the result can sometimes be rather boring. There are examples nearby in most parts of the Borough of how attractive a shop front can be. Elaboration will need a little more thought but can be worthwhile. On the other hand adding different features with no common style can create an unsightly jumble.

Text: COLOUR COLOUR

Text: COLOUR 4.1 The colours of the shop front (including fascia background, woodwork, frames, door, stallriser, etc.) should form an attractive colour scheme and one which is in keeping with the rest of the building above. A single overall dark colour often works well, aS does all white. Schemes with two colours usually work best when one of the colours is a neutral such as white or cream. The use of two strong contrasting colours together or three or more colours should usually be avoided.

Text: MATERIALS MATERIALS

Text: MATERIALS 5.1 Careful consideration should be given to the choice of all materials to be used. A good quality soft wood is often the most suitable material for most of the shop front, particularly for older buildings and can easily be repainted if the shop requires a change of appearance. Aluminium can often provide an acceptable substitute if finished in a colour to suit the overall colour scheme of the shop. Grey anodised aluminium framing is functional, but its finish is not very attractive, does not contribute positively to most colour schemes and is best kept for the smallest and simplest shop fronts. Stallrisers materials are discussed at 9.1.

Text: MATERIALS 5.2 For Conservation Areas the use of grey anodised aluminium framing or shiny/ reflective plastics for shop fronts or fascias will not usually be acceptable. Materials used must reflect the age and architectural style of the building.

Text: MATERIALS 5.3 For fascia signs matt/non-reflective materials look best and are easier to read. Avoid shiny plastic/acrylic finishes which can be difficult to read and tend to look out of place, particularly on traditional shop fronts.

Text: RETAINING VALUABLE FEATURES RETAINING VALUABLE FEATURES

Text: RETAINING VALUABLE FEATURES 6.1 The removal or obscuring of any high quality architectural features of a shop front or building which are worthy of retention will not normally be acceptable. High quality architectural features such as projecting consoles/corbels, fluted pilasters, detailed brickwork, etc. make an important contribution to the character and appearance of older buildings. A good design will incorporate any features worthy of retention into the new scheme.

Text: RETAINING VALUABLE FEATURES 6.2 There will be a particular presumption against the replacement of any original Victorian or Edwardian shop fronts or details. Original Victorian or Edwardian shop fronts are rare in Trafford and the retention of remaining examples is to be encouraged wherever possible. If the shop front is in a poor state of repair, or has been unsympathetically altered in the past, a good quality replacement may be acceptable.

Text: ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT

Text: ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT 71 Shops should be accessible to as wide a range of customers as possible, including wheelchair users and people with prams/pushchairs. This is in retailers interests and the public interest.

Text: ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT 7.2 The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 requires disabled access to be provided, "so far as it is in the circumstances both practicable and reasonable” to buildings, including shops, where the public are admitted. Additionally, the Council’s Unitary Development Plan (UDP) states that the Council will seek to ensure that where appropriate (in workplaces and buildings to which the public has access) new developments provide suitable access for people with disabilities (Proposal D1 (ix)).

Text: ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT 7.3 The minimum clear open width of a doorway for wheelchair access is 800mm, with 830mm preferred. Ideally there should be either a level or ramped access to the premises. Steps should not be introduced where noreexisted before. For further details see how the Council's leaflet ‘Designing for Everyone’.

Text: FASCIA SIGNS FASCIA SIGNS

Text: FASCIA SIGNS 8.1 Any shop front proposal should make provision for a fascia sign of acceptable size and location. Fascia signs should comply with the Council's Planning Guidelines - Advertisements (July 19%} to which reference should be made. An extract is printed at 8.4 below.

Text: FASCIA SIGNS 8.2 A common fault is the fascia being too deep, making the sign look too large and dominant. Fascias deeper than 20% of the total shop front height will usually look too deep and so will not normally be acceptable. There may be exceptions, for instance some large scale modem buildings might be suitable for a larger sign. In some cases even 20% will look too large and out of character with the building and its neighbours and lesser depth will be necessary. Any proposed increase in fascia depth will normally be looked at critically.

Text: FASCIA SIGNS 8.3 The fascia sign should not come forward of the plane of the shop front or any

Text: FASCIA SIGNS side pillar or pilaster - see section 2(d) and Figure 3. Nor should it be too wide or too high - see sections 2 (a) and 2 (0). :

Text: 8.4 Extract from the Council's Planning Guidelines - Advertisements:- 8.4 Extract from the Council's Planning Guidelines - Advertisements:-

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs "Shop Fascia Signs

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs a) Fascia signs should normally be compatible with neighbouring fascias in their position, height and depth and should not extend to the bottom of any first floor window sill.

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs b) The depth of fascia signs should be less than 20% of the total shop front height: signs over 20% will usually look too deep and so will not normally be acceptable.

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs c) The fascia sign should be in the same plane as the main part of the shop and should not come forward of any side pillar or pilaster.

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs d) Signs that would remove or cover over features of the original detail and style of the building should be avoided, especially where the premises form part of a block or terrace of related or similar design.

Text: "Shop Fascia Signs e) A proposed fascia sign should normally relate to only one shop or business unit: signs linking across two or more shop fronts that are likely to obscure building features or to inappropriately link buildings of different characters will not normally be allowed.”

Text: STALLRISERS STALLRISERS

Text: STALLRISERS 9.1 Shop fronts should normally include solid (not glazed) stallrisers of a minimum height of 450mm (ift 6ins). Stallrisers materials should either be the same as the facing material for the buildings upper floors, or be a matching part of the shop front. The stallriser (see Figure 1) is a traditional part of the shop front design providing part of the ‘frame’ for the shop display (and lifting it up to a more visible height), and has the practical use of protecting the glazing from splashes and knocks. Any applications which would result in the loss of a stallriser in favour of glazing ill normally be resisted.

Text: STALLRISERS 9.2 Certain modern developments such as the Arndale Centre, Stretford, and the northern end of George Street, Altrincham have been designed with only minimal stallrisers and continuation of this style in theses areas will normally be acceptable.

Text: 10. SECURITY 10. SECURITY

Text: 10. SECURITY 10.1 Care should be taken in the design of any new shop front to incorporate the need for security in a satisfactory way.

Text: 10. SECURITY Some designs of shop fronts whilst providing an attractive appearance for customers are vulnerable to burglary. The later bolting on of external shutters, for instance, if security proves to be a problem, will not necessarily be acceptable (see Section 11).

Text: 10. SECURITY 10.3 Items which may be worth considering for incorporation within the shop front design include:- ,

Text: 10. SECURITY - substantial stallrisers;

Text: 10. SECURITY - substantial mullions;

Text: 10. SECURITY - limits on the undivided width of window glass:

Text: 10. SECURITY - provision for the installation of internal shutters.

Text: 10. SECURITY 10.4 Other items which may assist security include secure doors and locks, good lighting, alarms, and surveillance systems. Advice on security may be available from the Police Community Safety Officers.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS SECURITY SHUTTERS

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS When considering planning applications for security shutters the Council will have regard to the following criteria:

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS - the need for additional security;

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS - whether the need could be met in some more visually acceptable way;

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS - the design and colour of the proposed shutter;

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS - the visual effects on the surrounding area.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS Any external shutters permitted will normally be required to have a factory applied paint finish in a colour appropriate to the remainder of the building and its surroundings. External roller shutters will only exceptionally be acceptable on Listed Buildings or in Conservation Areas.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS External roller shutters often detract from the design of the building and the character of the area. Solid shutters with a plain galvanised finish are particularly unattractive. Solid shutters prevent natural surveillance of the shop's interior and replace a shop's display area with dead space. A projecting shutter box may also spoil the frontage appearance. If the use of such shutters were to become common in a shopping area, the resulting fortified appearance would significantly reduce the area's attractiveness, and increase the general crime level, to the disbenefit of retailers as well as the public. Nor do external shutters necessarily prevent burglaries.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS Internal roller shutters, which do not normally need planning permission, are far more visually acceptable and are also considered to be as effective or more effective in preventing burglary than an extemal shutter. The use of lattice type internal shutters enables natural surveillance to be retained of the interior. The use of solid shutters behind the window display would prevent natural surveillance but would retain an attractive appearance and still enable window shopping to occur.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS ,

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS Other possibilities for increased security are referred to in section 10.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS 11.5 Applicants for external shutters in any area will therefore normally be encourage to look at alternative means of security. Frontages in the town and district shopping centres are particularly subject to loss of visual amenity from inappropriate shutters. This is bécause these centres play an important part in forming the image of the area and they are the focus for a range of activities which continue outside normal shopping hours. However the Council acknowledges that some shops retaining high value items may be at particularly high risk, and alternative means of security may not always be feasible.

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS 11.6 Of the various shutter types the lattice type is the least visually harmful. The perforated type has some through visibility at night when internal lights are on. Solid shutters have the most visual impact. There are no cases when a galvanised or aluminium finish is likely to be necessary or appropriate, and a factory applied paint finish should be used. Motifs io assist with advertising the premises could be incorporated. Dark or deep colours are normally best, chosen to harmonise with the shop front or fascia sign or the building.concerned. Bright colours should, however, be avoided. :

Text: SECURITY SHUTTERS 11.7 In Conservation Areas external shutters will normally be out of character and wiil only be considered if there is clear evidence of the premises being of exceptionally nigh risk and if it is clear that all other security options such as internal shutters are not feasible. In such cases the visual consequences for the character of the area will still need to be carefully weighed. Ifa planning permission is granted in such cases, it may be made personal to the owner and may be for a temporary period only, to avoid the perpetuation of shutters if the premises change hands and becomes no longer high risk, and ensure that shutters whose appearance deteriorates are not allowed to remain indefinitely.

Text: 13. QTLLUSTRATED EXAMPLES Modern building with fascia signs neatly separated by vertical structural elements. However the fascia sign on the right looks out of place because it is located higher than its neighbours, and the projecting shutter box and solid roller shutters look unattractive. Not having a stallriser on a modern building can be acceptable, as in this case.

Text: Summary. Summary.

Text: Summary. The premises have been established as a popular bar/café/restaurant for since 2015 when planning consent was granted for a restaurant/café (A3 use class as was) 86559/COU/15.

Text: Summary. More recently, with the change in life styles, has become a well- attended institution in the centre of Altrincham’s Market Area, but mostly popular in the evening.

Text: Summary. The existing shopfront, granted consent in 2015, is modern in appearance, metal and glass framed and at odds with the scale and massing of other more traditional shopfronts on the street.

Text: Summary. The applicant is aware of the sites importance within the Old Market Square Conservation Area and is keen to ensure that the new shopfront is simple, traditional in appearance and blends in with the character of the area and maintain trading throughout the day.

Text: Summary. The awning granted consent is to be retained with a new ‘timber painted’ shopfront, similar to that at Blanchflower next door, being crated.

Text: Summary. Shopfront outlined in red

Text: The location. The location.

Text: The location. The site is located in a parade of Commercial units mostly, based on the hospitality industry.

Text: The location. The existing shopfront is ‘modern’ in appearance and pays little respect to the scale of the other shopfronts in the area and conflicts with the appearance of that of Blanchflower, in particular.

Text: The location. P a g e | 1

Text: The location. The opposite side of the property is formed by the ‘side wall’ of M&S.

Text: The location. It is intended that the existing facia be retained and the awning granted consent under applications ref: 86559/COU/15

Text: The location. The remainder of the shopfront will be removed and replaced by a new timber shopfront with smaller glazing and opening windows and exposing some of the original brickwork either side of the proposed reinstated door.

Text: The location. The current door position will be moved to that of the original property when it was used as a shop, next to the alleyway between the property and M&S.

Text: Development of the scheme. As stated in the above, the desire is to produce a more sympathetic shop front reflecting the character of the conservation are and the principals set out in Trafford Council Planning Guidelines – Shopfronts dated July 1997. (See appendix 1)

Text: Development of the scheme. While this guidance is old, it has some important recommendations and the scheme has been designed so as to reflect the principals, namely:

Text: Development of the scheme. Design – This reflects the character of the Conservation Area and the predominance of frontage constructed from painted soft wood.

Text: Development of the scheme. Materials – Timber with mouldings and plain glazing. Retaining features – the new scheme will expose part of the original shop units brickwork, thereby giving a glimpse of the sites history.

Text: Development of the scheme. The new door way will have a minimum clear width of 900mm allowing wheelchairs to access the premises.

Text: Assessment. Assessment.

Text: Assessment. Key Planning Issues

Text: Assessment. The use of the site has already been established and as such the key issues are:

Text: Assessment. 1. Design of the shopfront and the impact on the heritage assets in terms of the Conservation Area and nearby buildings of significance.

Text: Assessment. Local/National Policy.

Text: Assessment. The site is located in the main commercial centre of Altrincham and already has an established use as a restaurant, use class A3.

Text: Assessment. Town Centre Policies S3 Improving the Main Shopping Centres and S6 Development in Altrincham Town Centre are particularly relevant to this site as is Supplementary Planning Documents PG 17 Shopfronts and D1 relating to all new development.

Text: Assessment. In addition, the site is within a Conservation Area and, as such, the impact on Heritage assets is important.

Text: Assessment. P a g e | 3

Text: Assessment. Location within the Old Market Place Conservation Area

Text: Assessment. SPD 5.3 identifies the site as being within Character Zone D, The Civic and Commercial Area.

Text: Assessment. The appraisal is silent about the property other than mentioning it was included in the 2014 revision to the conservation area boundaries.

Text: Assessment. The appraisal references the traditional style shop fronts and it does identify the property as having a positive impact on the character of the area.

Text: Assessment. The alleyway at the rear of the site is not a ‘through route’ and, as such the impact of the new shopfront structure will be limited on the character of the conservation area fronting Shaws Road.

Text: Assessment. The NPPF supports sustainable town centre development in para 86 and states that policies should ‘promote competitive town centres that provide customer choice and a diverse retail offer and which reflect the individuality of town centres;’

Text: Assessment. Para 81 says ‘Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business’. In this case the development is to allow the business to recover and trade effectively following the commercial impacts that it has suffered during the pandemic.

Text: Assessment. In terms of the impact on Historic Assets, Para 194 says The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no

Text: Assessment. P a g e | 4

Text: Assessment. more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.

Text: Assessment. Para 202 says ‘Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use’

Text: Assessment. In this case the development of this new shopfront, of a traditional appearance will have less than significant harm to the conservation area and will allow the business to secure its optimum viable use and as such is acceptable.

Text: Assessment. In addition the new entrance will allow a minimum of 900mm for access, meaning the wheelchairs will be able to use the doorway.

Text: Assessment. And in para 197, ‘In assessing and determining development proposals, local planning authorities should apply the presumption in favour of sustainable development.’

Text: Assessment. The proposal is for a traditional painted timber and glazed shopfront reflecting the character of many of the older retail units in the conservation area.

Text: Assessment. Consequently, there will be no harm to the conservation area character and the improvements to access for people with disabilities will support the aspirations of para 197.

Text: Assessment. In this case, it is clear that the development is sustainable in that it will also bringing into full time use, the premisses and provide an active frontage for the majority of the day, in the key area of Altrincham Town Centre.
