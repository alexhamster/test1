Text: Background Background

Text: Background 1.

Text: Background Telecommunications is a public utility that was provided by the Post Office until the decision was taken in the early 1980’s to privatise this service. This was achieved through the Telecommunications Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) and it was under Section 7 that the original mobile network operators (MNOs) were granted licenses. The Communications Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) ended the licensing regime established by the 1984 Act, but the operators retained their special status as Electronic Communications Code Network Operators (Code Operators, previously Telecommunications Code Systems Operators). The 2003 Act widened the opportunity for operators to become Code Operators, a

Text: Background key criteria being the public benefit of the network provided.

Text: Background 2.

Text: Background Although the MNOs are private companies, they all therefore provide a public service and one which is recognised as being essential to a modern economy. Setting aside the large contribution made by the electronic communications industry to the economy through direct employment and the sale of products and services, the local benefits will be varied and considerable. In addition, as the technology continues to improve, and the range of services become more varied and innovative, the benefits will also expand at a fast pace. A connected and modern smart phone is now able to access thousands of applications, which means that it is almost impossible to now quantify or specify all the potential benefits.

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity Growth of Mobile Connectivity

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 3.

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity Since the first mobile phone call was made in the UK in 1985, the mobile industry has delivered huge benefits to consumers and the wider UK economy. New mobile technologies - or generations - have been introduced roughly every 10 years, each offering improved services compared with previous generations. However, the existing 4G network rollout has been relatively rapid and MNOs are now deploying 5G which has meant that the timescales between mobile technologies has now reduced even further:

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 1G: the first generation of ‘cellular’ mobile phones, which used analogue radio transmission and supported voice calls;

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 2G: the second generation of mobiles, which used digital transmission and allowed for digital phone calls and messaging;

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 3G: the third generation of mobile communications enabled faster data services than those available on 2G networks, which led to the first consumer friendly mobile broadband internet experience for users; and

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 4G: the fourth generation of mobile communications is a more data-oriented network than its predecessors and is the first all-Internet Protocols mobile communications system. The main advantage of 4G services compared with previous generations are that they offer faster download speeds and quicker response times (latency).

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 5G: this next generation of mobile connectivity will deliver a step change of ultrafast, ultra-low latency, reliable, mobile connectivity, that is able to support ever larger data requirements, as well as wide-ranging new applications including machine to machine applications - intelligent machines that require no human input (e.g. advanced manufacturing). 5G will deliver these flexible networks by making use of multiple bands of spectrum.

They are supported by Government due to the significant economic and social benefits. There are many reports highlighting the significant growth and benefits of mobile connectivity. More recently, Ofcom’s Communications Market Report August 2019 and Connected Nations Report Spring 2019, together with Deloitte’s Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2018 advise:

In May 2018, the Financial Times article “UK digital technology sector outpacing wider economy” explained that the digital tech sector was worth £184bn to the UK economy in 2017, up from £170bn in 2016. This has significantly increased on those figures within the UK Government’s Information Economy Strategy (June 2013), that estimated that the digital sector alone contributed around £105 billion in GVA to the UK in 2011.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy 9.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy In terms of mobile connectivity, the UK Government is focused on supporting mobile connectivity and next generation technologies within a more facilitating legislative framework. So, this has seen, for example, the introduction of the new Electronic Communications Code allowing more economic access to sites, further relaxation of permitted development rights and greater protection to existing network infrastructure including digital connectivity forming part of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy 10.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy All four MNOs have now acquired, through Government spectrum auctions, frequencies that will be used to allow capacity improvements to existing networks and those suitable for deploying. Other spectrum, such as that to be released by clearing terrestrial television from the 700MHz spectrum will also allow 5G, mostly likely geared more towards low capacity wide area coverage, with a particular focus on rural connectivity. The 26GHz and above radio spectrum is likely to be used, in the future, for very dense and high capacity 5G coverage in towns and cities.

Text: Support from the Planning System The improvement of existing mobile networks and the delivery of 5G (and future generations of connectivity) requires a supportive legislative and policy framework, including the UK town planning systems.

Text: Support from the Planning System 20. National policy of all Governments, reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in England, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP), Planning Policy Wales and the Strategic Planning Policy Statement for Northern Ireland, is to support the provision of advanced mobile connectivity to help underpin and

Text: Support from the Planning System sustain national, regional and local economies. Mobile connectivity has become akin to the “fourth utility”, with commensurately high public reliance and expectation of an ubiquitous service. Within Appendix 1 we set out the main Government policy and objectives across the UK to support mobile connectivity.

Text: Support from the Planning System 21. What is wholly consistent within this overarching national planning policy support towards better connectivity, is that local planning authorities should not challenge whether a particular service is needed, but only the site-specific matters and justification considered against local policy and guidance. However, local planning authorities should recognise that without the deployment of next generation mobile connectivity like 5G, it is unlikely that the local planning authority will be able to meet other key policy objectives such as building sustainable communities, attracting new inward investment and delivering smart services.

Text: Support from the Planning System 22.

Text: Support from the Planning System It is very evident that the UK town planning systems have a major responsibility in helping to deliver these network changes and improvements in the public interest. The supportive national policy framework will also have to be reflected at local level through an appropriate policy framework that can be translated into balanced and positive development management decisions. This will require meaningful engagement with the industry and as well as effective decision making by local planning authorities. It will inevitably require proper balancing between operational and environmental considerations, particularly in the most sensitive of locations (like protected areas) where rural communities exist and aspire to have similar levels of mobile connectivity comparable to other urban areas of the UK. Although radio signals are invisible, the systems cannot operate without the necessary infrastructure system, which is no different from other forms of public communications infrastructure. For example, a railway network very obviously requires tracks, stations and parking facilities, whereas a mobile network requires a series of base stations, with communication masts, radio equipment housing and other associated

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy Implementing the UK Digital Strategy

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.1 Mobile and other forms of digital connectivity were once handy to have, perhaps even a luxury. However, as clearly recognised by UK Government in its Digital Strategy, they are now an essential part of everyday life.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.2

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy Advanced digital connectivity provides new business opportunities, allows the UK to be competitive in changing global markets and supports people in their everyday lives. From the first generation of analogue phones to modern 4G enabled smart phones, the UK public has embraced the benefits provided by better mobile connectivity. The UK Government’s Digital Strategy ambition is for the UK to be the global leader in the next generation of mobile technologies and digital communications like 5G and for the UK population to have access to world leading technology and lifestyles associated with those benefits.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.3 Next generation smart devices utilising 5G, will benefit from enhanced mobile connectivity and facilitate the expanding range of services available to communities. From the first generation which provided voice calls, second generation that allowed basic data such as texting and the third and fourth generation networks which have offered progressively better internet and video access and the development of a myriad of “apps”, the development of mobile connectivity continues at pace.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.4

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 5G brings a revolutionary approach to managing the spectrum and greatly increasing data speeds and will deliver ultra-fast wireless broadband connections. The public advantages and opportunities this presents will be revolutionary - near-instant downloads of HD films, smart medical devices and smart cities, connected autonomous vehicles and traffic management, smart manufacturing with heterogenous autonomous machines, direct machine to machine communication, automated agriculture, far greater security provision, more stable and reliable connectivity and advances in further application development and many uses not yet identified.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.5

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy It is estimated that 5G will directly contribute to an additional £7 Billion a year to the UK economy in just six years from roll-out and the significance of 5G is reflected in a range of Government policy:

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy “This Government has a clear ambition for the UK to be a global leader in the next generation of mobile technology – 5G. Good digital infrastructure is a building block of the Government’s modern Industrial Strategy - it creates new opportunities for growth by allowing business to be done on the move; unleashing dynamic business models; and opening up new opportunities and markets. It also supports us in our everyday lives - connecting us with friends, family and colleagues; helping us to stay safe; and giving us access to information and services that we increasingly take for granted. 5G promises a step-change in mobile connectivity with enormous potential to boost productivity and grow the economy, and we want the whole country to benefit. So, we will take a leading role in its development and roll-out, putting the UK at the forefront of the 5G revolution”.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy Department for Culture, Media & Sports - Next Generation Mobile Technologies: A 5G Strategy for the UK

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.6 The Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) deployment of 5G will start with our major centres and transport networks. The next phases will see coverage

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy extend across the whole of the UK, in line with coverage obligations and public demand for the services and benefits.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.7

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy The deployment of 5G will begin through utilising the MNOs existing 3G and 4G networks and so for a period of time, sites are likely to carry different services in parallel, with intelligence applied to ensure high data uses operate through the higher capacity networks. Although 5G will undoubtedly bring new opportunities and huge benefits to society, this can only be delivered with additional infrastructure and that will mean new structures, antennas and ancillary equipment.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.8

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy The success of 5G will be hugely dependent on its network resilience, especially if it is to be used for many of the planned services mentioned in paragraph 1.4, such as connected autonomous vehicles and smart medical services. Consequently, the network is likely to have a degree of duplication and overlap of sites to ensure full and reliable coverage, network capacity and operational resilience.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.9 New mobile technologies - or generations - have been introduced roughly every 10 years, each offering improved services compared with previous generations. However, the existing 4G network rollout has been relatively rapid and indeed 5G deployment will mean that the timescales between mobile technologies has now reduced further. Although this has huge benefits as indicated above, it does mean that the UK legislative systems, including planning systems, have to continually adapt to these changing circumstances.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.10 With each mobile generation, the types, amount and scale of apparatus needed to deliver new mobile connectivity change, and this will be even more evident with 5G. Government policy and permitted development rights will become more focussed on assisting the timely delivery of 5G, allowing the public benefits from the advances of this technology to be achieved.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.11

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy In turn all of this will be reflected in operator delivery obligations and timescales. Parity of new mobile services will also become more evident – reflecting concerns about digital divides and that connectivity should be universally available, bringing with it challenges of delivering new or improved services into geographically more peripheral population areas:

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy “Getting 5G deployment right will be critical in a future where connectivity is becoming integral to almost all parts of the economy, and the UK will put its future growth and competitiveness at risk it if falls behind”.

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy ‘Connected Future’ National Infrastructure Commission 2016

Text: Implementing the UK Digital Strategy 1.12 However, the one constant in the regulatory and policy framework is the continued emphasis on reusing and sharing existing sites as the best way of avoiding the unnecessary proliferation of new sites and so minimising potential environmental impact.

Text: 2.0 National policy support 2.0 National policy support

Text: 2.0 National policy support 2.1 Currently all the UK planning systems support advanced modern mobile connectivity, reflecting the UK Government’s Digital Strategy and significance of 5G to the UK economy. 5G and associated benefits are described in more detail in the accompanying Cellnex document ‘National Policy – Delivering Ultra Fast Broadband Mobile Connectivity’. Planning reform across all UK regions is now starting to reflect the specific support for next generation mobile technologies in particular 5G. For example, in England, the National Planning Policy Framework February 2019 states:

Text: 2.0 National policy support “Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being. Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections”.

Text: 2.0 National policy support 2.2

Text: 2.0 National policy support In relation to mobile connectivity, there is very clear emphasis on supporting advanced digital communications, but at the same time the importance of striking an appropriate balance with environmental considerations is still recognised, with emphasis on appearance and design as well as sharing existing sites.

Text: 2.0 National policy support 2.3

Text: 2.0 National policy support 5G installations will in many cases be larger than the latest generations, because of the greater amounts of apparatus to support. This will take us back to ground-based mast heights used more typically with the first generation, i.e.

Text: 2.0 National policy support 20 to 45 metres. However, this has to be viewed in the context of other, often much larger forms of essential public infrastructure that currently exist in urban and rural areas such as pylons, wind turbines, railway and road communications, street furniture, CCTV, and heating infrastructure. It is obviously a regrettable feature of a modern society that there will be some inevitable and unavoidable visual impacts associated with the public infrastructure necessary to serve us.

Text: 2.0 National policy support 2.4

Text: 2.0 National policy support The delivery of 5G mobile connectivity will therefore bring about the need for new infrastructure but no more and often less than might be expected to deliver other essential public services. The regulatory and policy framework encourages minimising the potential impacts, but as with previous generations this will be tempered by the special technical and operational requirements that appertain. With 5G these will be considerable and more so when compared to previous generations of mobile base station deployment which are explained below.

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations Special operational, technical and siting considerations

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations 3.1

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations The rollout of 5G equipment will initially be concentrated at a “macro” level, that being the upgrade of existing main base station or macro installations, coupled with the development of new macro installations. The potential for Small Cells, being micro base stations often utilising public infrastructure (like lamp posts) to provide dense urban 5G coverage (and capacity) will evolve as the technology is taken up. Initially this will be concentrated towards main cities and towns with greatest mobile phone demands.

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations 3.2 Many existing macro installations are on rooftops and stand-alone towers. These will need to be upgraded and, in some cases, redeveloped to accommodate the new equipment and antennas.

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations 3.3 Where a mobile operator already operates from a rooftop or mast and is therefore already providing mobile services to the local area, the 5G apparatus will be an upgrade of existing services and likely to provide coverage over the same area. As the reuse of existing sites accords with the regulatory and policy framework, there is no need to consider alternative sites, as made clear for

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations instance in paragraph 115(c) of the NPPF (England). In any event, to do so might also conflict with the existing network architecture and relocation might therefore be difficult, complex and time consuming to achieve.

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations 3.4

Text: Special operational, technical and siting considerations In other cases where the operator has no existing base station in the area, the new 5G installation will be located and designed so that it can integrate into the wider 5G network under deployment. This may be for coverage or other reasons such as network resilience as previously explained, but because of the increased density of sites, there may have to be achieved within tight siting parameters.

Text: Operational considerations Operational considerations

Text: Operational considerations 3.5 Whether it is the upgrade of an existing mobile base station or provision of a new site, a combination of the following operational considerations will apply:

Text: Operational considerations The need to provide an acceptable level of coverage over the target coverage area by the sector antennas and to meet expected demands and network resilience (antennas can only handle certain call and data levels)

Text: Operational considerations The need for a dense and superfast fixed fibre network, necessary for a 5G base station to rapidly process calls and data instructions and connect to the wider network

Text: Operational considerations Where necessary, point-to-point radio transmission dish antennas with heights required to allow direct line of sight

Text: Operational considerations Proximity to a suitable and reliable power source

Text: Operational considerations Positioning to meet public and occupational exclusion zones to meet ICNIRP guidelines (International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection)

Text: Operational considerations Demarcation and safety handrailing, protected cable routes, climbing access and some small signage

Text: Operational considerations An accessible route for construction and future maintenance access – pedestrian or vehicular

Text: Operational considerations A reasonable degree of security and associated signage

Text: Operational considerations A sympathetic and willing site provider

Text: Operational considerations For new ground-based masts, sufficient buffer space to allow for drop and exclusion zones

Text: Operational considerations Suitable ground and rooftop conditions to accommodate load bearing apparatus

Text: More apparatus requirements More apparatus requirements

Text: More apparatus requirements As 5G will operate across multiple radio spectrums it will require additional antennas and new equipment cabinets. Each generation of mobile base station has introduced slightly different antenna requirements, technical and siting considerations. Generally, each generation of mobile connectivity has seen the number of antennas required being reduced, particularly due to the sharing capability of newer antenna systems and network consolidation agreements between some of the MNOs. 5G is likely to require more antennas due to the need to ensure resilient coverage and in some locations, particularly towns and cities, the operators may need additional antennas simply to meet network capacity requirements.

Text: More apparatus requirements 3.6

Text: More apparatus requirements 3.7 Previous mobile generations used sector or omni directional antennas sited high to provide geographical coverage over the cell area in a blanket fashion. In urban areas, the 5G frequencies allocated by Government will not travel as far, which means the network will have to be denser. To ensure efficiency the antennas will be more “intelligent”, more optimised and highly ‘directional’. 5G antennas will therefore be highly advanced, in many cases using multiple-input multiple-output technology (MIMO) which essentially allows new antenna technology to be “smarter” and better track and communicate simultaneously

Text: More apparatus requirements with multiple mobile users.

Text: Greater height and siting implications Greater height and siting implications

Text: Greater height and siting implications 3.8

Text: Greater height and siting implications This has implications for siting and design. On building rooftops in particular, 5G antennas will need to be much closer to the building edge to avoid

Text: Greater height and siting implications shadowing and antenna ‘clipping’ off the edge of the buildings and to allow the smart “tracking” features of the antennas.

Text: Greater height and siting implications Source: Cellnex Blackheath Telephone Exchange – roof edge 5G antenna configuration

Text: Greater height and siting implications 3.9 Clipping of signals is already an important operational factor reflected in planning guidance such as this diagram from Annex C of Planning Advice Note 62 in Scotland, but now more prevalent to 5G:

Text: Greater height and siting implications Source: Annex C of Planning Advice Note 62 in Scotland

Text: Greater height and siting implications 3.10

Text: Greater height and siting implications If this is not possible, then the antennas may have to be located higher on structures in the centre of the roof, but raised to a height to avoid the same ‘clipping’ issues. For antennas on ground-based masts, they will also have to be sufficiently high and clear of obstacles that can degrade signal propagation and be sited close to the target area.

Text: Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements

Text: Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements 3.11 As new 5G antennas will also continue to provide other services like 3G and 4G (the antennas allow shared frequencies and shared services), they will normally be larger and so greater in appearance (although there is an expectation that 5G antenna technology and design will evolve and may reduce over time).

Text: Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements Source: Cellnex Trowell Services – 5G antenna and feeders

Text: Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements 3.12 In turn, larger and heavier 5G antennas, are likely to require more supporting steelwork on rooftop installations. Necessary antenna supporting apparatus will also require additional supports.

Text: Larger apparatus and redevelopment requirements 3.13 Where 5G antennas are to replace those on an existing mast, the additional structural and wind loading of the new 5G antennas (and necessary support apparatus) may necessitate redevelopment of the existing structure.

Text: More antenna support apparatus More antenna support apparatus

Text: More antenna support apparatus 3.14 As new 5G antennas will provide other services like 3G and 4G and antennas can be shared by more mobile operators (as part of radio network sharing agreements), they will also require a greater range of ancillary apparatus to combine the different radio frequencies and also help regulate signal / power loss between the equipment in the equipment housing and the antennas themselves.

Text: More antenna support apparatus 3.15 This ancillary apparatus will be mainly small units normally behind or very close to the antennas. In some cases, they may be grouped on purpose-built support apparatus, but however configured it will necessitate higher and larger structures to support these additional complements.

Text: More antenna support apparatus Source: Blackheath Telephone Exchange – 5G antenna support apparatus

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity Greater reliance on fibre connectivity

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity 3.16 Unlike earlier networks, 5G will rely more on dense fixed line fibre networks as these are both reliable and very high capacity. As a consequence, fibre routes and the opportunity to extend them will significantly influence siting and design of new installations.

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity 3.17

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity In some cases, network requirements may also require dish antennas (transmission dishes) that operate on a direct ‘line of sight’ basis, a bit like a search light beam, to other dishes on corresponding installations on the network. This is likely to be the case where the 5G base station also incorporates planned other mobile services such as 4G. Fibre and dish “backhaul” requirement for 5G are very important as:

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity They link the base station to the wider national network, which in turn is linked to other national and international networks

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity Link the base station to a master control centre that manages the call handover process that occurs when a mobile user moves from one cell area to another

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity Likely to provide telemetric monitoring to ensure the site is working properly, with some faults able to be fixed remotely.

Text: Greater reliance on fibre connectivity 3.18 Base stations also require cabinets to house the electronic communications radio equipment and an electricity meter cabinet for the necessary power connection. For 5G base stations sited on buildings, these cabinets are normally located at roof level to reduce feeder lengths, which if too long can affect radio signals and antenna performance.

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints Additional rooftop siting constraints

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints 3.19 Additionally, on rooftops, the following considerations will also apply:

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints Antennas have to be positioned to avoid radio interference with any existing equipment already installed on the building.

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints All apparatus has to be maintainable in accordance with general health and safety requirements including the Construction Design Management regulations.

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints All apparatus has to be installed in a structurally feasible manner.

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints On a rooftop, all apparatus has to be clear of existing features such as access points, air conditioning units, roof lights, or other electronic communications apparatus.

Text: Additional rooftop siting constraints Apparatus has to be installed in accordance with the requirements of the building owner.

Text: ICNIRP compliance implications ICNIRP compliance implications

Text: ICNIRP compliance implications 3.20 As some 5G apparatus will operate at higher power levels than earlier generations, it will need to be elevated higher off building rooftops, to ensure public exclusion zones can be maintained (see “5G - Health and Safety for more information)”.

Text: ICNIRP compliance implications 3.21 Rooftop installations, whether new or existing will all be subject to this constraint and so require more prominently sited apparatus, which is a factor to bear in mind when considering alternative sites.

Text: Interference considerations Interference considerations

Text: Interference considerations 3.22 The mobile network operators are also under a legal obligation to comply with the conditions of their licences granted by Ofcom. These conditions ensure compliance with legal obligations in respect of avoiding interference between themselves, with other radio systems, other electrical equipment, instrumentation and air traffic systems. The conditions of the licence are mandated by Ofcom who are responsible for the regulation of the civilian radio spectrum. Ofcom also has powers to investigate and remedy any reported significant interference.

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.0 Town Planning implications

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.1

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications All of this presents more complex issues for both the mobile operators, site owners and also additional considerations for Local Planning Authorities, as previously 2G, 3G or 4G systems could generally be accommodated without

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications the need for the same extent of extra supporting structures, support apparatus and antenna heights.

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.2

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications All new proposals will still have to operate within the prevailing ICNIRP (International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection) guidelines and that will influence siting and design to a greater extent than before.

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.3

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications The special technical and operational factors that apply to 5G will therefore affect siting and design considerations greater than before. This document should help explain these key considerations and how they are material considerations that must be reflected in town planning decisions.

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.4

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications All that said, it is recognised that any proposal must strike an acceptable balance with environmental considerations and the Government recognises that the best way to achieve this is still through sharing and the reuse of existing infrastructure.

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications 4.5

Text: 4.0 Town Planning implications In weighing the balance, it is also necessary to take into account the now massive and still growing public demand for mobile connectivity and the revolutionary nature of the many and considerable public benefits that 5G will deliver to support a prosperous economy and to make our lives safer and more convenient.

Text: CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE

Text: Background Background

Text: Background 1. Countries around the world have set aggressive targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, the UK Government adopted one of the toughest climate change targets with a commitment to meet net zero emissions by 2050.

Text: Background 2.

Text: Background To achieve this ambitious but very important target, it means the UK emitting as much as it is removing from the environment and essentially an end to the UK’s contribution to global remissions in 2050.

Text: Background 3. However, this is not just about reducing fossil fuel use, recycling, better managing our resources and wastage and electrifying our transport. That alone will be insufficient. It has to go much further than that. It’s about changing how we act as individuals, how communities might adapt and embrace new sustainable living and working practices and how public services and industry might adopt technology to support responsible practices, more efficiency and reduce resource use. This in turn requires our cities, towns and villages to evolve and become “smarter”, efficient and more self-sustaining. We have to look more closely at advanced modern technologies like 5G to achieve this.

Text: Background 4.

Text: Background Technical advancements in electronic communications will be a key driver and help underpin and support many of these necessary changes. 5G mobile connectivity will be essential to meet these changes. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport’s (DCMS’s) July 2018 Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review stated that is the Government’s aim for the “majority of the UK” to have 5G mobile coverage by 2027”, so we have to move fast and if anything, the seriousness of the current climate concerns will pull this date forward.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? So, how will 5G help tackle climate change?

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 5. Mobile communication networks in themselves rely on power and as data usage increases, the energy to power these networks will inevitably also increase. However, mobile communication networks themselves contribute a very small percentage of CO2 emissions globally and many operators now look to utilise power from renewable resources.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 6. More importantly, however, is that these network carbon emissions have to be offset against the enormous contribution mobile communications networks will have to reducing carbon emissions across all aspects of life as we explain further. These benefits will significantly offset the carbon footprint of running the networks.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 7.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 5G is the next generation of mobile connectivity and will deliver a step change of ultrafast, ultra-low latency, flexible and reliable mobile connectivity, that is able to support wide-ranging new “applications”, including machine to machine applications, that will help to drive forward and support our daily activities and help the UK meet zero carbon targets.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 8. 5G and associated “Internet of Things” (IoT) capability, with the UK blanketed with ultra-fast mobile connectivity, will bring about a growth of new services and greater dependability. This will help underpin UK’s sustainability and carbon reduction policy by, as examples:

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Reducing energy consumption for the mobile network through more efficient network operations – in simple terms, due to much lower energy required to transmit the same volumes (or more) of data, 5G should outperform 4G by an order of magnitude and 2G/3G networks by many times. It is a much cleaner network technology.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 5G will allow previous generations of mobile connectivity to be switched off over time, removing the power requirements of older and less efficient networks

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 5G will drive new handsets, which will need to be more power efficient and using more refined ‘Adaptive Power Controls’, so network energy usage is better managed

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? 5G will offer significant improvements in capacity and data speeds, which means a level of connectivity that can genuinely support and better manage critical services such as health, power, public services and transport – in turn advancing new technologies that might allow more efficient working practices and reduce carbon footprints for consumers, services and industry. To name a few these might include:

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Parking space availability applications, with locational notifications to smart phone, so avoiding the need to travel around city centres trying to find a space and helping to improve air conditions

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Taxing sharing services, where groups of individuals might plan shared taxi rides around a city centre, avoiding unnecessary route duplication

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Crowdsourced bus services i.e. the sharing of anonymised data with privately run bus operators to suggest new routes which are determined by community demand. This leads to more efficient public transport and helps to reduce private car usage (already available in cities like Singapore)

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Monitoring of remote service vehicles like rubbish vehicles to optimise refuse and waste services

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Maintenance and repair notifications from domestic and industrial machinery like washing machines i.e. a replacement part is ordered well in advance of failure, allowing more efficient replacement

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Implanted communication advices that support “telehealth” applications such as allowing remote monitoring of public health services and patients e.g. pace makers, oxygen tanks, respirators, environmental monitors in patients homes – that allow advanced replacement as part of a more efficient and timely services and reduce unnecessary checks and travel

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? “Connected” ambulances with 5G capability which can forward in advance medical conditions of patients, so allowing the triage of medical responses by Emergency Department staff and supporting more efficient health care services and resource planning

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Remote consultations with 5G allow medical appointments to take place remotely via high-quality video calls, more reliably than is currently possible – so meaning that patients do not need to make unnecessary travel

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? An ability to support a far larger number of connected devices (including IoT devices) and smart “applications” and supporting new green technologies and businesses including our ability to control our homes – for examples, being able to turn heating on when needed and in advance of arriving home or turn off remotely so to minimise energy waste

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? An extension in the battery life of ‘sensors’ that will underpin many 5G and IoT services, thanks to lower power requirements

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Greater reliability and dependability, through massive resilience in the networks, so allowing smart city features like smart motorways that adapt to traffic levels or environmental conditions i.e. regulating car speeds during congestion periods or in times of poor air conditions

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that can use communications technologies to send and receive information to and from other vehicles and/or surrounding road infrastructure. They also use sensors and software to operate without human intervention but can allow driver assistance or report vehicle maintenance and safety. This could be faulty emissions, sending data about a vehicle’s performance back to the manufacturer to identify faults more quickly or to a garage.

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Bringing high speed blanket connectivity to areas with little connectivity exists – so supporting different approaches to how and where we live and work (such as supporting more rural enterprises) and influencing travel choices through remote working:

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? For example, a worker who would normally travel 20 miles to and from work each day (40 miles) and could; through 5G, work from home two days a week, would reduce travel emissions by 80 miles a week (which could be around 3700 miles a working year). That would be a reduction of over 80 gallons of petrol (based on @ 45 mpg) and associated carbon emissions

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? More efficient production techniques and just in time services through real time monitoring and reduction of waste

Text: So, how will 5G help tackle climate change? Allowing real time energy consumption information or accurately predict or react to known activity periods that might allow smarter energy management and production

Text: How should the planning system help? To maximise the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, that can be achieved by smart cities, towns and rural areas, local planning authorities will need to facilitate the timely roll-out of 5G.

Text: How should the planning system help? 10. National policy of all Governments, reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in England, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP), Planning Policy Wales and the Strategic Planning Policy Statement for Northern Ireland, is to support the provision of advanced mobile connectivity. We expand more on the huge policy support for 5G and associated economic and social benefits in our accompanying document ‘National Policy - Delivering Ultra Fast Broadband Mobile Connectivity’.

Text: How should the planning system help? 11. Policymakers can also play a role in ensuring that the public sector is an early adopter of 5G. This will spur the proliferation of use cases and generate economies of scope in the use of 5G.

Text: How should the planning system help? 12. In terms of supporting 5G, local planning authorities must also understand the nature of 5G technology and the specific network requirements, which will bring about new apparatus needs, specific sites (coverage and capacity), height requirements and generally larger apparatus. We explain this further within our accompanying supporting document ‘5G Technical Support’.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.0 Introduction

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.1 Cellnex sites transmit nothing more than ordinary radio waves.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.2 Radio waves are electromagnetic fields, and unlike ionising radiation (such as X-rays or gamma rays), can neither break chemical bonds nor cause ionisation in the human body.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.3

Text: 1.0 Introduction In the UK, radio waves have been used by a whole range of public and commercial communication networks since the dawn of radio in 1922, when the BBC opened its first regular public broadcasting station (in the world) in London. Radio waves have underpinned the UK’s growth, prosperity and social inclusion. Radio waves have ensured the safety of our communities and supported national security. The UK’s public radio and television broadcasting networks have been transmitting non-ionising radio waves in the UK since the 1920s.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.4 Cellnex sites support a range of wireless communication services that rely on radio waves, particularly mobile communication base stations, that operate in the wider public interest.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.5 The health effects of exposure to radio waves have been researched extensively over several decades, and very many publications can be found in scientific journals and elsewhere. Coordinated research around the world has addressed concerns about the growth of mobile communications technologies from around the year 2000.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.6 Through extensive studies providing peer reviewed evidence, no causal link has been discovered between mobile connectivity and a risk to health.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.1 Mobile phones are now ubiquitous throughout our society and many companies, industries, organisations and individuals rely upon such essential connectivity. Mobile communications technology has developed through several generations and there are now many mobile communication sites,

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G known as ‘base stations’, installed throughout the UK, providing services to users of mobile phones and other connected devices.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.2 5G reflects the next technological revolution, which will bring significant social, economic and environmental benefits to the country. This is likely to include autonomous vehicles, interconnected industrial machinery and robotics used in logistics, medicine, manufacturing, agriculture and health care services. This list will be ever expanding, such is the significance of 5G.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.3

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G In order to prepare the UK for this connectivity revolution, 5G is being deployed throughout the UK by the mobile network operators (MNOs). In the UK the MNOs are BT/EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three. Initially the MNOs will be deploying 5G in cities and towns and along major transport routes, but eventually this will be deployed to the whole of the UK.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.4 Radio frequency is a scarce resource and is highly regulated to ensure efficiency of use and avoid interference between uses. The MNOs can only use spectrum allocated to them by Government, via Ofcom the industry regulator. In allocating spectrum for particular uses, Ofcom will have regard to internationally agreed standards, to allow international use and roaming.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.5 To ensure effective use, frequency is generally allocated via auction, with conditions to ensure wide geographical coverage and high quality service. In the UK the current mobile networks operate at frequencies of around 900Mhz and between 1.8GHz and 2.1GHz.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.6 With regard to 5G, Ofcom has designated the following frequencies, which fall into three main categories:

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G Low frequency spectrum (the 700 MHz band), with likely emphasis on rural areas as the signal can cover larger areas

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G Mid-frequency spectrum (the 3.4–3.8 GHz band) for large bandwidths to provide necessary network capacity and to enable higher speeds – the first deployments of 5G mobile services are likely to use this band in towns and cities; and

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G Higher frequency spectrum (26 GHz band), sometimes known as millimetre wave (“mmWave”) - providing ultra-high capacity but with very small coverage ranges.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.7 All these frequencies have been ‘reallocated’ from previous uses such as terrestrial television broadcasting, defence and satellite communications. So, these frequencies are not new and have been used for many years in wireless communications services across the UK, now simply reallocated for mobile connectivity.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.8 Similar to previous generations of mobile installations, 5G will consist of various types of infrastructure necessary to allow the network to operate, including antennas, radio towers, masts and dedicated in-building systems. This is no different to other forms of essential public infrastructure which are now common place in our cities, town and rural areas.

Text: 2.0 Mobile Connectivity and 5G 2.9 5G networks will work in conjunction with existing networks such as 4G, but will have site specific siting requirements to reflect the apparatus to be used. In many cases, existing ‘macro’ (main) 3G/4G mobile base stations will be first upgraded to allow for new 5G equipment and service provision. ‘Small cell’ technology will also become a growing feature of 5G networks, particularly in dense urban areas likes cities and towns, mainly offering additional data capacity necessary to support a range of uses, including innovative new uses like Connected Autonomous Vehicles and new connected medical applications.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.0 Health and safety compliance

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.1 Throughout the history of mobile connectivity there have been concerns raised with regards to the Health and Safety of these systems. A great deal of research has been undertaken throughout the world into the effects of electromagnetic radiation and radio signals and to date there has been no evidence to indicate that the systems so far operated and those intended to be operated have caused any discernible adverse health effects.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.2 Over 50 years of scientific research has already been conducted into the possible health effects of the radio signals used for mobile phones, base stations and other wireless services including frequencies planned for 5G.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.3 Cellnex does not set its own health and safety standard but relies on these guidelines covering the safety of radio transmissions, which have been adopted by the UK Government on the advice of Public Health England (which is the statutory adviser on the safety of radio transmissions across all of the UK. Advice by other Government Public Health bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will therefore largely adopt the same guidance.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.4 Public Health England (PHE) guidance on the health and safety of mobile phone base stations can be found below

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mobile-phone-base- stations-radio-waves-and-health/mobile-phone-base-stations-radio- waves-and-health

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.5 This has since been updated to reflect considerations relating to 5G mobile connectivity:

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-technologies-radio- waves-and-health/5g-technologies-radio-waves-and-health

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.6 Significantly, PHE advises that:

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance “independent expert groups in the UK and at international level have examined the accumulated body of research evidence. Their conclusions support the view that health effects are unlikely to occur if exposures are below international guideline levels”.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance “It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area. However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health”.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.7 PHE’s main advice about radio waves from mobile base stations is therefore that the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) should be adopted for limiting public exposure to mobile communication network apparatus.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.8

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance ICNIRP is formally recognised as an official collaborating non-governmental organisation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). ICNIRP is also consulted by the European Commission. The ICNIRP guidelines apply to frequencies up to 300 GHz and cover exposures arising from new 5G base stations (including mmWave technology) as well as from older technologies.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.9

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance It is worth noting that the ICNIRP Guidelines were adopted by the UK in 2004, because they contain a greater ‘precautionary factor’ than the previous UK guidelines by an additional factor of 100%. This was a key part of the UK Government’s response to the Stewart Report on Mobile Phones and Health, published in 2000, which recommended a precautionary approach. Another key part was the establishment of a research programme that forms part of the large body of peer reviewed scientific research that has built up over the last 50 years and which has not found any causal link with any health effects, other than the well understood thermal effects.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.10 It should also be appreciated that mobile installations are low powered, typically operating between a few watts to a maximum of 100 watts, depending on the type of installation and whether it hosts one or all of the MNOs. Mobile technology also uses Adaptive Power Control to operate at the lowest levels necessary to provide an effective service – power outputs therefore increase and decrease accordingly to public usage. Mobile installations therefore generally comply with the ICNIRP guidelines by a factor of hundreds and in many cases thousands.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.11 Whilst it is true that some of the 5G frequencies will operate at higher powers, they will remain low powered and still have to operate within the ICNIRP guidelines which have been recently amended in 2020.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.12 ICNIRP provides a series of Frequently Asked Questions and explains that the new guidelines cover exposures from 5th Generation (5G) mobile telecommunications.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance https://www.icnirp.org/en/rf-faq/index.html

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.13 The new guidelines states that:

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance “ICNIRP (2020) has made a number of changes……will ensure that 5G is not able to cause harm”.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.14 The ICNIRP guidelines consider both thermal and non-thermal effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF):

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance “ICNIRP considers all potential adverse health effects, and sets restrictions to ensure that none occur, regardless of the mechanism of interaction between the exposure and the body. The lowest exposure levels that can cause adverse health effects are due to thermal mechanisms, and so restrictions have been set based on the thermal effects, as these will protect against any other effects that could occur at higher exposure levels”.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.15 In common with previous generations and all forms of electronic communications, 5G installations will have health and safety (ICNIRP) compliance zones where the public will be excluded and these may vary depending on base station type, e.g. macro or small cell, and antenna use and type. The larger antennas likely to be required on some macro base stations may bring particular siting and design considerations, especially where they are an addition to existing configurations. For example, this may require antennas to be sited higher off roof level and / or for a greater fenced area to keep out members of the public. The key constant to emphasise however, is that ICNIRP compliance would be retained in all nearby areas accessible by the public and given the way power outputs drop exponentially, then that is likely to remain within a considerable margin.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.16 If for whatever reason existing compliance zones or new ones required due to the introduction of 5G technology cannot be created, then the site would be deemed unsuitable. However, as the same frequencies allocated for 5G have been used previously for television broadcasting, defence and satellite purposes and at significantly higher power outputs, this is not likely to be widespread as those former uses complied with the same applicable guidelines.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.17 Previous generations of mobile connectivity have been subject to an Ofcom ‘testing programme’ to assess Electromagnetic Field (EMF) measurements at mobile base station sites across the UK. Ofcom has now continued such testing to base stations now providing 5G and to date has assessed 22 5G sites in 10 UK cities. A link to that report is provided below:

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/190005/emf-test- summary.pdf

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.18 Consistent with its testing programme for previous generations of mobile connectivity, Ofcom advises that the measured EMF levels from 5G-enabled mobile phone base stations:

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance Remain at small fractions of the levels identified in the ICNIRP Guidelines, the highest level recorded being approximately 1.5% of the relevant levels

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 5G currently contributes a small amount to the EMF levels measured at each location.

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance 3.19 In summary, every installation on a site owned or managed by Cellnex will be compliant with these international standards adopted by the UK Government and will be certified as such with all applications for planning permission. The ICNIRP guidelines seek to protect against the well-known thermal effects of radio emissions and include a significant precautionary factor. These guidelines apply to all forms of electronic communications and mobile technology is one of the lowest powered of these. National planning policy remains clear that provided an application is certified as ICNIRP compliant, then local planning

Text: 3.0 Health and safety compliance authorities should not seek to effectively set different guidelines through the refusal of planning permission.

Text: 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research

Text: 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research 4.1

Text: 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research It should be noted that exposure measurements made by one of PHE’s predecessor organisations found that “many exposure measurements have been made in the UK at publicly accessible locations near to base stations, and these have consistently been well within the ICNIRP guideline levels”.

Text: 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research 4.2 Notwithstanding this, Public Health England (PHE) continues to monitor the health-related evidence applicable to radio waves, including in relation to base stations, and is committed to updating its advice as required.

Text: 4.0 Monitoring and Future Research 4.3 Cellnex will clearly consider any new guidance as and when produced by PHE or other relevant advisors.
