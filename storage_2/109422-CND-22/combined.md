Text: WELCOME WELCOME

Text: WELCOME Thank you for choosing the Conservation Rooflight®. We are sure that the Conservation Rooflight® will provide a high-quality finishing touch to your project. This guide is intended to assist building contractors and homeowners in receiving, handling and installing the Conservation Rooflight®. Please take the time to read and carefully follow these instructions. Before you start your installation, please refer to the ‘IMPORTANT INFORMATION’ section at the back of this installation guide.

Text: GENERAL GENERAL

Text: GENERAL Please note: the minimum roof angle at which the Conservation Rooflight® can be installed is 17.5 degrees. Please note: the maximum roof angle at which the Conservation Rooflight® can be installed is 65 degrees. Please note: the following installation details pertain to COLD ROOF construction and CLAY tile type installed ‘on the rafters’, with use of the flashing kit. Some installation details may vary depending on the roof construction and tile type being used. Always view this manual in conjunction with the cross sectional installation details relevant to your project. See Section 8 (Pages 25, 26 & 27) ‘Suggested installation details’ towards the back of this manual.

Text: GENERAL In order to install the Conservation Rooflight® you will need to know:

Text: GENERAL 1. The Conservation Rooflight® model to be installed.

Text: GENERAL 2.

Text: GENERAL The type of roof construction to be used, e.g. warm roof or cold roof.

Text: GENERAL The type of roof tile to be used, e.g. clay tiles, slate, interlocking tile, pantile, zinc or lead sheet, etc.

Text: GENERAL 4. Whether you wish to install ‘on the rafter’ or ‘between the rafter’

Text: CONTENTS OF THE BOX Before you can derive the structural framing dimensions you will need to understand which of the following options apply to your project:

Text: RECEIVING THE ROOF WINDOW RECEIVING THE ROOF WINDOW

Text: RECEIVING THE ROOF WINDOW We recommend that the roof window packaging is temporarily opened to allow inspection of the goods for damage. Follow the instructions on the delivery checking and advice label.

Text: ON THE RAFTER OR BETWEEN THE RAFTER ON THE RAFTER OR BETWEEN THE RAFTER

Text: ON THE RAFTER OR BETWEEN THE RAFTER The type of tiles used affects how the roof window is installed. One of the following options will be used:

Text: On the Rafter (Standard Installation): On the Rafter (Standard Installation):

Text: On the Rafter (Standard Installation): This installation (as the name suggests) installs the roof window with it sitting on top of the rafters. For the majority of profiled tiles (Clay, Pantile etc) the roof window remains flush to the top of the tiles and will not project above the finished roof line. For thinner tile types (Slate) the roof window will not be flush and will project above the finished roof line. If a flush detail is required for thin tile types then a ‘between the rafter’ (commonly referred to as Flush Slate) installation is required.

Text: On the Rafter (Standard Installation): Once the roof window has been checked, repackage u it in the original packaging for safe storage until the roof window is to be installed.

Text: Between the rafter (Flush Slate Installation): Between the rafter (Flush Slate Installation):

Text: Between the rafter (Flush Slate Installation): When tile types are thinner and a standard ‘on the rafter’ installation would result in a non-flush installation; a ‘between the rafter’ installation can be used. The roof window is sunk in between the rafters to a depth equal to the height that it would protrude above the finished roof line if a standard installation was used, nominally to a sunk depth of 20mm (Installers are advised to check this dimension prior to installation). Due to the roof window being sunk below the top of the rafters, the associated structural framing sizes increase. Likewise, dependent upon the pitch of the roof, the run-off required at the cill tilting fillet may vary. Nominally quoted framing sizes use the lowest installation pitch and calculate for worst case scenario.

Text: TRANSPORT & STORAGE TRANSPORT & STORAGE

Text: TRANSPORT & STORAGE Keep the roof window in its original packaging and store off the ground in a secure covered dry place until it is required for u installation.

Text: TRANSPORT & STORAGE When transporting the roof window in its box, carry the box by lifting it from the underside rather than lifting by its u strapping.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Only carry the box if the banding is attached in its original condition. Do not carry by the box if the nylon banding has been cut or appears in any way damaged.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Warm roof In a warm roof construction, the insulation is positioned directly under the external waterproofing (e.g. tiles or slates), following the rafter line.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Cold roof

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE In a cold roof construction, the insulation layer is placed horizontally, directly above the ceiling of the upper story of the habitable section of the building, usually positioned between the joists in the loft space.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Stack multiple units carefully and only as many units high as is set out on the transport information label on the box.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE u

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Only remove the roof window from its packaging when it is required for installation.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Once unpacked carry the roof window by lifting it from the underside of the baseplate.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE Mark the original box with the window number/location and keep all accessories and linings in the original box until they are required. When the installation is complete and all accessories/linings are used, recycle all of the packaging materials.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE u

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE INSTALLATION HEIGHT

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE The maximum height that can be used with the flashing kit is 75mm for all tile types. This is measured from the top of the soaker extrusion (part 6) to the top of the structural support (as shown). If your tiles are thicker than this then we recommend the use of lead soakers or mortar bed at the jambs.

Text: WARM OR COLD ROOF CONSTRUCTION TYPE NOTE: The flashing kit is only suitable for ‘on the rafter’ installation.

It is a prominent feature in both local buildings and is also an ideal match for the stone work originally used around the Liverpool and North Wales area.

Text: Quarry Location Due to the quality and durability of the quarried block, Cumbrian Stone’s St Bees Sandstone products can now be found on projects across all areas of the UK.
