Text: FOREWORD FOREWORD

Text: FOREWORD This Design and Access Statement is to support the proposals at 1 Centralway and George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1SB. The development site straddles both Centralway and George Street, and as existing is mixed use of leisure and retail along the opposite frontages. The existing building on site is complicated in nature and has no real architectural merit for conversion. It is therefore proposed that the building is to

Text: FOREWORD be demolished as part of the works.

Text: FOREWORD The development site sits within the George Street Conservation Area. As such the proposals have been designed in tandem with the George Street Conservation Area – Supplementary Planning Document SPD5.1 - Conservation Area Appraisal – October

Text: FOREWORD 2014

Text: FOREWORD This document will introduce and outline the design philosophy, site analysis and illustrate the proposals for the scheme, which is for a new-build 4 storey building to Centralway and a 3 storey building to George Street. The use for the site will be a combination of retail, leisure and offices, representing an exciting new opportunity for the centre of Altrincham.

Text: SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT

Text: SITE LOCATION + IMMEDIATE CONTEXT The development site is located centrally within Altrincham and straddles the land between Centralway and George Street. As existing the site is home to 2 retail units fronting George Street and 1 food and drink venue operating onto Centralway. Within close proximity to Altrincham Market and various leisure offerings, the site is a prime location for new development and has the potential to beneficially contribute to Altrincham’s growing vibrancy.

Text: Centralway Centralway

Text: Centralway Centralway has historically been considered to be a service road, serving the many retail units fronting George Street. As the market quarter has grown in popularity in recent years, its possible to see the change as more offerings spread down Centralway from Shaws Road. The design of the proposals seeks to become part of this growth and will provide an active frontage onto Centralway by the means of a food and drink venue. Above, the proposals will create 3 floors of A grade offices, of which Altrincham

Text: Centralway is highly in need of.

Text: George Street George Street

Text: George Street George Street, the main strand of the George Street Conservation Area, is Altrincham’s main retail location and Altrincham’s historic medieval lower town. The typology of its architecture is varied and eclectic. Often the shop-fronts are of less Architectural interest than the upper storeys, where the merit can be seen in Georgian and Victorian frontages, displaying their character in the form of brick detailing of various colours and

Text: George Street the use of vertical window hierarchy.

Text: George Street The proposals seek to re-invigorate the frontage to George Street, which is arguably dated and no longer appropriate for a building in such a prime location in the Conservation Area. The proposals will take architectural cues from the adjacent buildings both in scale and detailing, whilst maintaining a contemporary feel as to not appear pastiche.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT Taking a broader view of the sites location its possible to identify the ‘Market Quarter’ in which it sits. In this document this is defined by the square parcel of land which encompasses Greenwood Street, Centralway, and Shaws Road.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT This area has been very clearly defined by the Markets influence in recent years and is host to Altrincham;s most popular food, drink and leisure offerings. By identifying this we can understand the context into which the proposals will sit, which in turn has informed the many design decisions that have been made.

Text: SITE LOCATION + WIDER CONTEXT To the South East of the Market Quarter, George Street acts as an arterial route through Altrincham, connecting solely via Shaws Road. As a design driver, the proposals intend to create a new link from George Street to Centralway. This connection is an important aspect of the proposals. Connecting these important streets will alleviate their perceived separation in urban deign terms and create activity within the site,

This transport hub is extermely well connected by rail bus and tram and fuels the daytime and nughttime econcmy of Altrincham. This is key in contributing to the sustainability of the site and the proposals ,which will more than likely be used by people who travle via Altrincham Interchange.

Text: AMOUNT The amount of the proposals are deemed to be appropriate to the capacity of the site and its wider context. The proposals seek to create 2 distinct and reasonably proportioned buildings fronting onto both streets, whilst creating an intimate courtyard between which breaks up the mass of the scheme and creates a new and exciting parcel of public realm in the town.

Text: INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS

Text: INITIAL DESIGN DRIVERS 01_ The site itself is long and thin and has distinct and differing presentations to both Centralway and George Street. It is landlocked to one side by the Everyman and projects ahead of The Bricklayers Arms. Centralway opposes George Street’s conventional frontages with its informality. 02_ There is an existing ginnel that runs through the site. This is unattractive and therefore rarely used. The proposals will seek to re-introduce the lost connection between Centralway and George Street. 03_ As a result of the proposed route through, the proposals will look to create a new space within the site as an intention to activate the whole site, rather than solely the two frontages. 04_ In 3 dimensions the site can be represented as a cuboid. 05_ Bounded by George Street and Centrakway he proposasl seek to split the mass of the site. 06_ By carving a space in the centre of the mass we can create 2 new hidden frontages. 07_ The bulk of the mass is now split, creating new public realm and activation

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY From an early stage in the design process the design team has looked to Altrincham’s

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY existing fabric to understand the palette of materials and forms into which the scheme

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY will sit.

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY Although predominantly traditional, materials have been widely used around Altrincham to create a distinctive palette of red brick, painted and rusted metal, light sandstone, glazing and striking patterns. This palette has been created over time and can be seen in some of Altrincham oldest to most recent buildings.

Text: MATERIALS + FORM IN THE LOCALITY It is this strong material and colour palette which the proposals intend to celebrate. Creating a place that evokes familiarity has been at the front of the team’s design ethos. Th scheme will acknowledge its place in the conservation area and therefore its forms will be influenced by the shapes of Altrincham. The scheme has focused on the gable feature, window heirarchy and treatments and the courtyard.

Text: SITE PLAN The proposals can be understood as 2 distinct buildings facing either Centralway or George Street. In between these there is a landscaped courtyard wihich has ramped and stepped access and leads to the leisure and office units.The courtyard is integral in balancing the levels difference between George Street and Centralway and will form an exciting piece of public realm in Altrincham.

Text: ACCESS CONCLUSION

Text: ACCESS The proposals outlined in this statement have shown evidence of a well considered design proposal which addresses its Conservation Area context and provides high quality accommodation which will be a significant benefit to Altrincham town centre.

Text: ACCESS The site itself is challenging and unique in nature, where each frontage is of equal importance. The team has endeavoured to address and pre-empt, where appropriate, local authority concerns, resulting in a tried, tested and bespoke design solution.

Text: ACCESS In terms of accommodation the building is providing 5 storeys of grade A office accommodation, 2 storeys of leisure accommodation and 1 storey of retail accommodation. The scheme has 100% cycle storage and contains all the appropriate facilities for a contemporary mixed use development.

Text: ACCESS In form the building is contemporary, but nods to traditional materials and familiar silhouettes and is well suited to the area, which is characterized by traditional but unique architecture.

Text: ACCESS This scheme is a significant opportunity to provide Altrincham with much needed office and leisure accommodation in the form of a high quality, well designed scheme that will stand the test of time. As such the proposals should be considered for approval.
