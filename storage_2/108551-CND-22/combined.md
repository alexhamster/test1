Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.1.1

Text: 1.0 Introduction To the south of the site in St John’s Road is a 225mm diameter combined water sewer flowing east to the larger sewer in Ashley Road. There are no surface water sewers in close proximity.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.1.2 A CCTV survey has been completed within the current site. Serving the building and rear car park is a network of private combined drains that outfall unrestricted to the combined sewer in St John’s Road via two connections.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.2 Existing Runoff

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.2.1 The existing site is fully developed with impermeable roof and car park areas, and therefore the site can be considered to be fully Brownfield. As such the existing brownfield flow rates from the site have been defined in the table below based on the area of the redevelopment.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3 Geology

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3.1 A detailed site-specific intrusive investigation has been carried out at the site. This identified shallow made ground over loose brown sand to a maximum depth of 9m BGL. Refer to Figure 3 below for an extract of the window sample at the location of the infiltration tank. No formal soakaway tests were completed at the time of the investigation. However, based on the underlying sand, infiltration is very likely to be suitable. In lieu of any tests an infiltration rate of 1.4x10-4 m/s (0.5m/hr) has been used in the hydraulic calculations.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach detail below:

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach Method Suitability Suitability for Development Infiltration to Ground Yes Intrusive site investigations would indicate that the underlying ground is suitable for infiltration. Connection to Watercourse No No watercourse in close proximity. Connection to Surface Water Sewer No No surface water sewer in close proximity. Connection to a Combined Sewer No Infiltration option takes precedent.

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy The SuDS assessment and hierarchal approach discussed in Figure 4 above has defined the overall SuDS strategy. The general principal of the surface water drainage strategy is to collect the runoff from the roof of the residential dwellings the existing and new downpipes. The water will then be directed to a new below ground surface water drainage network that will outfall to a geocellular infiltration tank located in the rear car parking area. The car park area itself will drain to the permeable surfacing located in the parking bays. This approach significantly reduces the runoff from the site to the downstream combined sewer network.

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy 2.6.2 A detailed drainage GA drawing and calculations can be found in the Appendices. This has shown no flooding for both the 30-year and extreme 100 year + 40% climate change event.

Text: 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy beneath in Blue.

Text: Condition 15 Condition 15

Text: Condition 15 The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced unless and until a scheme to improve the surface water disposal from the site has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be one of the two options listed below and must be in accordance with the drainage hierarchy:

Text: Condition 15 • Dwg No. (PL) 018 Rev. A (Infiltration Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 • Dwg No. (PL) 018 (Attenuated Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The SuDS hierarchal approach has been considered in Section 2. The site investigation has informed that infiltration is viable. A conservative rate for loose sand of 1.14x10-4 has been used at this time and the hydraulic calculations prepared using this rate to define the tank size. Overall SuDS will take the form of an infiltration tank and permeable paving.

Text: Condition 15 Refer to Appendix A for the drainage GA and Appendix B for the hydraulic calculations.

Text: Condition 16 Condition 16

Text: Condition 16 The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied unless and until a management and mainte- nance plan to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme for the lifetime of the devel- opment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The manage- ment and maintenance plan shall include the arrangements for adoption by an appropriate public body or statutory undertaker, management and maintenance by a Residents' Management Company or any other arrangements to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme throughout its lifetime. The management and maintenance plan shall be implemented for the lifetime of the de- velopment.

Text: Condition 16 The long-term maintenance of the new private (non adopted) drainage infrastructure will be with the property owners and a maintenance company in line with best practice guidance. Annual inspections will need to be carried out and clearing of drainage chambers, gullies and permeable paving. Typically the maintenance regime will be in line with Figure 5 below.

Text: NOISE CONTROL 10.2 Piling works will be carried out using Giken ‘Silent & Vibrationless’ Pile Pressing methods. Conventionally prefabricated sheet piles have been hammered or vibrated into the ground and generate excessive noise and vibration. Giken has developed the reaction-based press-in machine the "Silent Piler" and established the "Press-in Method" based on the principle of non-pollutive pile installation. In practical terms, the Silent Piler grasps previously installed piles and derives reaction force from the negative skin friction and interlock resistance of these reaction piles. This reaction force provides press-in force to hydraulically jack subsequent piles into the ground. Since the piles are

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3.1 A detailed site‐specific intrusive investigation has been carried out at the site. This identified shallow made ground over loose brown sand to a maximum depth of 9m BGL. A formal soakaway test was completed three times at the location of the soakaway to the rear of the development. This confirmed the lowest infiltration rate of 2.18x10‐6 m/s.

Connection to Watercourse No No watercourse in close proximity. Connection to Surface Water Sewer No No surface water sewer in close proximity. Connection to a Combined Sewer No Infiltration option takes precedent.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach The SuDS assessment and hierarchal approach discussed in Figure 4 above has defined the overall SuDS strategy. The general principal of the surface water drainage strategy is to collect the runoff from the roof of the residential dwellings the existing and new downpipes. The water will then be directed to a new below ground surface water drainage network that will outfall to a geocellular infiltration tank located in the rear car parking area. The car park area itself will drain to the permeable surfacing located in the parking bays. This approach significantly reduces the runoff from the site to the downstream combined sewer network.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6.2

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach To reduce the risk of flooding a high level overflow will be installed on the network that connects back to the combined sewer. This will be set above the level of the infiltration tank.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6.3 A detailed drainage GA drawing and calculations can be found in the Appendices. This has shown no flooding for both the 30‐year and extreme 100 year + 40% climate change event.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach Each point of conditions 15 & 16 are listed below in italics with the Brennan Consult response beneath in Blue.

Text: Condition 15 Condition 15

Text: Condition 15 The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced unless and until a scheme to improve the surface water disposal from the site has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be one of the two options listed below and must be in accordance with the drainage hierarchy:

Text: Condition 15 Dwg No. (PL) 018 Rev. A (Infiltration Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 Dwg No. (PL) 018 (Attenuated Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The SuDS hierarchal approach has been considered in Section 2. The site investigation has informed that infiltration is viable. An infiltration rate of 2.18x10‐6 has been used and the hydraulic calculations updated using this rate to define the tank size. Overall SuDS will take the form of an infiltration tank and permeable paving.

Text: Condition 15 Refer to Appendix A for the drainage GA and Appendix B for the hydraulic calculations.

Text: Condition 16 Condition 16

Text: Condition 16 The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied unless and until a management and mainte‐ nance plan to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme for the lifetime of the devel‐ opment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The manage‐ ment and maintenance plan shall include the arrangements for adoption by an appropriate public body or statutory undertaker, management and maintenance by a Residents' Management Company or any other arrangements to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme throughout its lifetime. The management and maintenance plan shall be implemented for the lifetime of the de‐ velopment.

Text: Condition 16 The long‐term maintenance of the new private (non adopted) drainage infrastructure will be with the property owners and a maintenance company in line with best practice guidance. Annual inspections will need to be carried out and clearing of drainage chambers, gullies and permeable paving. A separate Management and Maintenance plan has been prepared.

Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: Introduction Groundtech Consulting have been instructed by Quinta to undertake soil percolation testing for a proposed site development located off St John’s Road in Altrincham. Below is a concise SuDS Appraisal in accordance with the agreed scope of works.

Text: Introduction The site was previously occupied by a disused Medical Centre in the southern area with a tarmac car park to the north and an outbuilding in the centre of the car park used for storage.

Text: Introduction The objective of the Ground Investigation was to determine the soil infiltration rates for the proposed development of 5 No. residential buildings and an extension to the current basement.

Text: Site Works Site Works

Text: Site Works Groundtech Consulting visited the site on 2nd September 2022. One machine trial pit (SuDS1) was excavated to a depth of 2.0m bgl. Soil percolation testing was carried out at this location in general accordance with BRE Digest 365.

Text: Site Works The location of the soil percolation test is shown on the Exploratory Hole Location Plan GRO-21262-P07 and the trial pit log is appended.

Text: Made Ground Made Ground

Text: Made Ground Tarmac surfacing was observed from the surface to a depth of 0.08m bgl.

Text: Made Ground The following Made Ground was encountered during the investigation:

Text: Made Ground Black sandy gravel of mixed lithologies including ash and slag was observed to a depth of 0.5m bgl.

Text: Made Ground Brown slightly clayey gravelly sand with gravel of mixed lithologies including brick and slag was observed to a depth of 1.15m bgl.

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) Soil Infiltration Rate (m/sec)

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) The soil percolation tests were performed in the natural gravelly Sand of SuDS1 which was encountered from 1.15m to 2.0m bgl. Water was pumped into the trial pits and three tests were carried out, each lasting for 2 hours with measurements of the water level being taken at regular intervals. The depth of the water did not significantly reduce in the test location, particularly during Test 2 and 3.

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) Soil infiltration rates of 2.18 x 10-6 m/s and 8.55 x 10-6 m/s have been calculated which indicate poor drainage conditions exist within the underlying natural soils.

The potential exists for ground conditions to be encountered which are different to those considered in this Report, particularly between exploratory holes. The extent of the limited area depends on the soil and groundwater conditions, together with other constraints such as the position of any existing structures and underground utilities. If so stipulated in the Agreement, geo-environmental testing was carried out for a limited number of parameters based on an understanding of the available operational and historical information, and it should not be inferred that other chemical species are not present.

The groundwater level often has not had time to reach equilibrium and a monitoring period is required. Furthermore, groundwater levels are subject to seasonal variation or changes in local drainage conditions and groundwater levels may occur at other times of the year which are higher than were recorded during this investigation.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Purpose

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION In October 2021, Heritage Architecture Ltd (HA) were commissioned by the Quinta Group to provide a Level 2 historic building record of St Johns Medical Centre, Altrincham, Trafford (Figure 1, below).

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The building has been identified by the Local Planning Authority (LPA), Trafford Council (TC) as ‘non- designated heritage asset’ (NDHA) and is situated within the Downs Conservation Area, Altrincham. Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. There are a number of conditions attached to the consented application, with Conditions 3 and 4 relating to the need for a Historic Building Record (HBR; Condition 3) and an accompanying method statement (Condition 4).

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the following report is to provide a Level 2 Historic Building Record of the building in order to discharge Condition 3, which states that:

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION “No development, including demolition, shall take place until a detailed survey and photographic record in accordance with Level 2 of Historic England's Understanding Historic Buildings: A Guide to Good Recording Practice (2016) of the structures to be demolished has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A copy of the report shall also be deposited with the Greater Manchester Historic Environment Record and Trafford Local Studies Library”.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION This report consequently provides a Historic Building Record, meeting the standards established by Historic England for a Level 2 record, as agreed with Trafford Council, in order to support the Planning

Text: 1.2 Methodology 1.2 Methodology

Text: 1.2 Methodology The below survey has been completed to a Level 2 standard, as described in Historic England’s document ‘Understanding Historic Buildings: a guide to good record practice’. It involves a full survey of the St Johns Medical Centre, which is to be developed into a residential scheme under the consented proposals.

Text: 1.3.2 Written record 1.3.2 Written record

Text: 1.3.2 Written record This survey follows Historic England’s guidance set out in Understanding Historic Buildings, a guide to good recording practice (2006). This essentially forms a descriptive record of the site. Under the Level 2 recording guidance; Historic England explains the extent of the approach of the record, that:

Text: 1.3.2 Written record “May be made of a building which is judged not to require any fuller record, or it may serve to gather data for a wider project. Both the exterior and the interior will be viewed, described and photographed. The record will present conclusions regarding the building’s development and use, but will not discuss in detail the evidence on which these conclusions are based. A plan and sometimes other drawings may be made but the drawn record will normally not be comprehensive and may be tailored to the scope of a wider project”

Text: 1.3.2 Written record As such, a descriptive record has been compiled of typical, and key room types and features covering both the interior and exterior of the building, which is accompanied by general and detailed photographs where necessary. The descriptions comment on construction, materials, architectural details, original uses and likely dates/phasing. Areas which have been subject to alteration / modernisation are also identified within the present report.

Text: 1.3.2 Written record The survey of the former medical centre is arranged by floor level, starting with the ground floor and concluding at the roof level. Key areas of the building, such as staircases, are grouped together.

Text: 1.3.4 Drawn record Recent survey plans of each floor of the site have been produced by others, and are included as part of the floor by floor survey (Figure x and x). These plans are not representative of the current condition of the building, which was subject to a soft strip exercise (consented removal of non-significant fabric), therefore, many of the partitions and fixtures evident on the plan have since been removed.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre is located within the Downs Conservation Area in Altrincham, under the jurisdiction of Trafford District Council. As shown in Figure 2 below, the Site sits to the east of a series of 20th century maisonettes, this development has taken the place of the former St John’s Vicarage.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations There is an adjoining wing to the east of the building which has steep pitched roof running at a perpendicular angle to the main elements of the medical centre building. This was constructed added to the main building later in the 19th century as an additional hall. This wing is not under the same ownership and is now in use as dwellings. Further east of the site is the grade II listed Church of St John the Evangelist ‘St John’s Church’, designed by J. Medland Taylor, 1865-6.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre was constructed as St John’s School in 1876. It is asserted within the Heritage Statement report (Issued: June 2020) that the former school and grade II listed St John’s Church are disassociated, and the school does not fall within the curtilage of the statutory listed heritage asset.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations As demonstrated in Figure 3 (below), the site is situated within the Downs CA and was first designated on 8th February 1973 and has been extended three times since. St Johns Medical Centre is located within Character Zone C: The Downs Southeast Area of the Downs Conservation Area and together with St John’s Mews is identified in line with Historic England’s criteria as a positive contributor.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham It is believed that Altrincham’s original street layout was set out in Roman times due to its relationship with Watling Road. This formation then became the basis for Anglo-Saxon field boundaries.1

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The Normans arrived in Cheshire in 1070 and on defeating the Saxon Lords, gifted an estate in the Altrincham area to one of his Barons. The population grew throughout the 13th and 14th centuries and an established medieval town was created with a Royal Charter granted by King Edward I in 1290 and increasing trade and market activities.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The town declined during the Black Death and sources indicate that it remained a declining and deprived town until the 17th century when restored investment of landowners and patrons, chiefly the Earls of Stamford, instigated an increased revenue and subsequent growth.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham In the 18th century the Bridgewater canal connected Altrincham with Manchester, enabling transportation of goods and instigating a wave of development with many medieval buildings being reconstructed in brick.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The 1801 census shows there were 340 houses in the town with the upper and middle classes clustered in the high town and poorer families in the low town in the area around what is now George Street and Goose Green. The area around the site was at yet undeveloped at the start of the 19th century (Figure 5, map regression below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham During the late half of the 1800s the population of Altrincham grew rapidly, almost quadrupling in size; spurred by the arrival of the railway in 1849. This saw the arable farmland to the south and east of the historic commercial centre of Altrincham developed for the first time.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St John’s Church (grade II) was built 1865-6, designed by J. Medland Taylor. The Vicarage to the west of the site, which is no longer in existence, was also designed by Medland Taylor and built around this time (Figure 7). The late 19th century commentators noted that the Church of England had built the church specifically to accommodate the working classes (and counter the local non-conformists) and claimed the title “the poor man’s church”. Having worked to establish a congregation this factor accounts for the later construction of the adjacent primary school, although this was also necessary to meet the requirements of the 1870 Education Act which provided state funding to build new school.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. John’s primary school was built as a National School with part state funding. The ‘National Schools’ movement (‘The National Society for Promoting Religions Education’) had started much earlier in 1811 to promote the education of the poor “in the Principles of the Established Church”, or the Church of England. National Schools paralleled the aims of ‘British Schools’ which were founded on Protestant non-conformist, non-denominational principles in a movement started in 1808. The governing aim of

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham D e c e m b e r

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham the National Schools was a partial response to non-conformism to try to ensure that, "the National Religion should be made the foundation of National Education and should be the first and chief thing taught to the poor, according to the excellent Liturgy and Catechism provided by our Church”. As a result, the early 19th century churches were often implemented by the local vicar and members of the Church of England and stressed religious education.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Church of England resisted early 19th century attempts for the state to provide secular education. This control changed across the century, and by the last quarter of the century secular education was made compulsory. Most of the currently surviving National schools were finally fully absorbed into the state system under the Butler Act of 1944, but many state primary schools maintain a link to the Church of England, reflecting their historic origins. St. John’s primary school followed this nationwide pattern.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Site, St John’s School, was built in 1876 as the St. John’s National School and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries and the requirements of the education act (Figure 4). The detachment from the church was enhanced with the later construction of the Parish Hall (refer to Figures 6 and 7 below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The construction of the former St John’s School followed the passing of the 1870 Elementary Education Act which required partially state- funded board schools to be set up to provide primary education in areas where existing provision was inadequate. These schools were managed by elected school boards, which often included local church representatives (as remains the case today). The opening of St. John’s primary School coincided with the passing of the Sandon Act in 1876 which finally imposed a legal duty on parents to ensure that their children were educated and had stimulated another surge in school building.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. Johns remained in school use until it was acquired by the NHS in the late 1980s and was comprehensively converted and extended to accommodate the new use. The adjoining former Parish Hall has also been converted to residential use and the church closed in 2017. The school has been subject to a series of adaptions implemented by the NHS accommodate new services, parking and clinical practices continuing into the last decade, prior to the medical practice relocating and the to premises being sold for development in January 2020.

The mid-19th century maps shows the area in which the site now stands remained undeveloped land until the middle of the 19th century. The overall site originally formed the farmstead of Goralsgate Farm. Part of the land was occupied at one stage by John Douglas as a joiner’s workshop and timber yard.

The mid-19th century map illustrates housing had begun to develop in the land just north of the Downs, with fashionable Victorian Terraces evident. The 1851 census showed these roads harboured artisans, commercials, managers and professional people, and a few people carried out industry in wool, silk and cotton.

The 1967 map shows that in seven intervening decades almost no notable changes have occurred to the site and its immediate surroundings. The only notable change is the creation of the outbuilding at the rear, a version of which remains today. It is worth noting that the vicarage is still visible in this map to the west of the site (Figure 9). The below photograph (Figure 10) is a near contemporary and illustrates the original side entrance and roof form.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The external appearance of the building from the principal façade retains the character that it would have had at the turn of the 20th century but has experienced some alterations which shall be elaborated on this section.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The main difference to the principal facade is the single storey side extension which adjoins the building to the west (Figures 15 and 18). This was granted planning permission on 27th March 1991 (application no. H/32847). Whilst the main materials such as the snecked stone and slate roof are appropriate, the building form, single storey with a mansard-style roof, is slightly at odds with the original building. There are also some roof lights added as part of the 2008 application (application no. 70694).

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation Figure 4 also shows the gable with fine intricate wooden lattice. This is in good condition and, if it is original, appears to have been restored. Behind the lattice the building material appears to be pale, coursed brick, the date of which is unknown. The stonework on the gable below the lattice is discoloured and could benefit from some restoration.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation As seen in Figure 5 with the spire of St John’s Church in the background, the protruding late 19th century gable (greyed-out element in this photograph) shields the main part of the building from the church, effectively intersecting between the site and the heritage asset.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The front elevation is not of great architectural interest, but it retains its original character as a Victorian gothic vernacular building with interesting features such as the wooden lattice and mullion stone windows.

Text: 4.2 West Elevation The entirety of the west (side) elevation is not original (with regards to plan form) and was extensively altered in the late-20th century (application no.

The side extension imitates the design features of the main building such as the mullion windows as shown in Figure 7.

Text: 4.2 West Elevation The extension on the north west corner of the building, beyond the gate, is likely to date from the early 20th century and appears to be a remodelling of the historic extension that stood in the same location. The materials used for the extension are dark engineering brick (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 10). Whilst only partially visible from the public realm it can been seen down the side-access route from the street.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation The photographs of the rear elevation (Figure 9 to Figure 23) show the three additional dormers inserted as part of the 1997 planning permission (application no. H/44360). Despite the use of timber with white infill these dormers do little to respond to the design of the rest of the building and appear oversized in relation to the existing building and the mullion windows below. The rear elevation was always far plainer than the front elevation, lacking the ornate latticework in the gable. The large slate- covered void comprising the lift-plant room visually detracts from the elevation.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation From the north west, the blank façade of the extension in dark coursed brick is even more visible and overrides the material quality and detailing of the stonework on the rear elevation (Figure 10). The small outbuilding comprises a single-storey structure of common-brick bond, established c.1990s.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The building was designed in 1876 as the ‘St. John’s National School’ and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The ground floor was dedicated as the principal space for daily teaching and activities, with ancillary rooms likely used as cloakroom and additional classroom spaces. The central component of the building was divided into two parts, which reflects the usual arrangement of 19th century school buildings, which traditionally allowed for a separate ‘hall’ space for each sex. This arrangement is reflected in the separate playgrounds to the rear (Figure 25, below), which would have been accessed by independent exits to the rear of the building.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR It is thought that the central hall spaces to the ground floor historically comprised a double heighted space, which was later divided c.late 20th century when the building was converted into a medical centre; to create two separate floors. The west wing to the north-west of the building is however, believed to have always comprised of a ground and first floor. The original staircase and timber joists to this part of the building appear to date to the late-19th century and confirm this notion. The west wing of the building retains some evidence of historic fabric including original timber floors and chimney breasts but was extensively altered in the 1980s and again in the early 21st century to facilitate a new use (NHS doctors).

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. Following this, a soft strip exercise was undertaken to remove internal partitions and fixtures of no heritage significance. The soft strip allows for a better understanding of the building’s original plan form and historic components. The survey which has informed the present report (including images) was undertaken in November 2021 following completion of the soft strip.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Figure 26 and 52 below provide a visual indication of retained historic fabric (shaded red) and areas which are later alterations (in green) which were not removed as part of the soft strip exercise.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Whilst no original plans of the building are known to survive, historic mapping from 1876 provides some indication of the general internal layout of the ground floor to the former school building, which was formed of two principal rooms to the centre with smaller rooms to the west wing. The original brick walls (now overpainted) have been retained as part of the soft strip works and better convey the original, open plan form of the central hall spaces which were divided by a single wall. The soft strip has further revealed the original timber floorboards and original corbels which support the trusses above, these would have originally been experienced as a double heighted space; but the insertion of a new floor in the late-20th century / early 21st century has altered this.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Access to the girl’s hall was originally provided from an entrance to the west and the boys entrance was situated to the east. The classrooms to the ground floor would have been designed to be well-lit, to ensure optimum daylight during teaching hours. The 1876 plan below (Figure 25) illustrates another

Text: INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION

Text: 1.1 Purpose 1.1 Purpose

Text: 1.1 Purpose In October 2021, Heritage Architecture Ltd (HA) were commissioned by the Quinta Group to provide a Level 2 historic building record of St Johns Medical Centre, Altrincham, Trafford (Figure 1, below).

Text: 1.1 Purpose The building has been identified by the Local Planning Authority (LPA), Trafford Council (TC) as ‘non- designated heritage asset’ (NDHA) and is situated within the Downs Conservation Area, Altrincham. Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. There are a number of conditions attached to the consented application, with Conditions 3 and 4 relating to the need for a Historic Building Record (HBR; Condition 3) and an accompanying method statement (Condition 4).

Text: 1.1 Purpose excluded from the site / proposals. Source: site visit, November 2021.

Text: 1.1 Purpose The purpose of the following report is to provide a Level 2 Historic Building Record of the building in order to discharge Condition 3, which states that:

Text: 1.1 Purpose “No development, including demolition, shall take place until a detailed survey and photographic record in accordance with Level 2 of Historic England's Understanding Historic Buildings: A Guide to Good Recording Practice (2016) of the structures to be demolished has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A copy of the report shall also be deposited with the Greater Manchester Historic Environment Record and Trafford Local Studies Library”.

Text: 1.1 Purpose This report consequently provides a Historic Building Record, meeting the standards established by Historic England for a Level 2 record, as agreed with Trafford Council, in order to support the Planning application for the refurbishment/alteration of the building. This accords with the requirements of the NPPF (2021, para.192 and 205).

Text: 1.2 Methodology 1.2 Methodology

Text: 1.2 Methodology The below survey has been completed to a Level 2 standard, as described in Historic England’s document ‘Understanding Historic Buildings: a guide to good record practice’. It involves a full survey of the St Johns Medical Centre, which is to be developed into a residential scheme under the consented proposals.

Text: 1.3 Scope of Survey 1.3 Scope of Survey

Text: 1.3.1 Historical research and descriptions 1.3.1 Historical research and descriptions

Text: 1.3.1 Historical research and descriptions Supplementary research was based upon primary and secondary sources including maps, drawings and reports from Trafford Archives.

Text: 1.3.1 Historical research and descriptions The following report is further supplemented by non-intrusive, on-site surveys which have informed the significance appraisal of the site, as outlined within the original Heritage Statement report (Issued: 26 June 2020 - Heritage Architecture Ltd).

Text: 1.3.2 Written record 1.3.2 Written record

Text: 1.3.2 Written record This survey follows Historic England’s guidance set out in Understanding Historic Buildings, a guide to good recording practice (2006). This essentially forms a descriptive record of the site. Under the Level 2 recording guidance; Historic England explains the extent of the approach of the record, that:

Text: 1.3.2 Written record “May be made of a building which is judged not to require any fuller record, or it may serve to gather data for a wider project. Both the exterior and the interior will be viewed, described and photographed. The record will present conclusions regarding the building’s development and use, but will not discuss in detail the evidence on which these conclusions are based. A plan and sometimes other drawings may be made but the drawn record will normally not be comprehensive and may be tailored to the scope of a wider project”

Text: 1.3.2 Written record As such, a descriptive record has been compiled of typical, and key room types and features covering both the interior and exterior of the building, which is accompanied by general and detailed photographs where necessary. The descriptions comment on construction, materials, architectural details, original uses and likely dates/phasing. Areas which have been subject to alteration / modernisation are also identified within the present report.

Text: 1.3.2 Written record The survey of the former medical centre is arranged by floor level, starting with the ground floor and concluding at the roof level. Key areas of the building, such as staircases, are grouped together.

Text: 1.3.3 Photographic record 1.3.3 Photographic record

Text: 1.3.3 Photographic record A photographic record of the exterior and interior of the site was compiled in colour digital by Heritage Architecture Ltd. in November 2021.

Text: 1.3.3 Photographic record Photographs typically include general photographs of the exterior and of typical and key room internally. Detail photographs were taken of specific historical or architectural features.

Text: 1.3.4 Drawn record 1.3.4 Drawn record

Text: 1.3.4 Drawn record Recent survey plans of each floor of the site have been produced by others, and are included as part of the floor by floor survey (Figure x and x). These plans are not representative of the current condition of the building, which was subject to a soft strip exercise (consented removal of non-significant fabric), therefore, many of the partitions and fixtures evident on the plan have since been removed.

Text: 1.3.4 Drawn record The adapted plans have been included and adapted to illustrate the level of fabric which survives internally. They are not intended for construction or any other purpose and are included for information only.

Text: 2. THE SITE 2. THE SITE

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre is located within the Downs Conservation Area in Altrincham, under the jurisdiction of Trafford District Council. As shown in Figure 2 below, the Site sits to the east of a series of 20th century maisonettes, this development has taken the place of the former St John’s Vicarage.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations There is an adjoining wing to the east of the building which has steep pitched roof running at a perpendicular angle to the main elements of the medical centre building. This was constructed added to the main building later in the 19th century as an additional hall. This wing is not under the same ownership and is now in use as dwellings. Further east of the site is the grade II listed Church of St John the Evangelist ‘St John’s Church’, designed by J. Medland Taylor, 1865-6.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations Figure 2: Asset map showing statutory listed heritage assets in the vicinity (approximately 100m) of the Site (extent of which is indicated within the red line boundary). Source: Historic England, NHLE Mapping tool.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre was constructed as St John’s School in 1876. It is asserted within the Heritage Statement report (Issued: June 2020) that the former school and grade II listed St John’s Church are disassociated, and the school does not fall within the curtilage of the statutory listed heritage asset.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations As demonstrated in Figure 3 (below), the site is situated within the Downs CA and was first designated on 8th February 1973 and has been extended three times since. St Johns Medical Centre is located within Character Zone C: The Downs Southeast Area of the Downs Conservation Area and together with St John’s Mews is identified in line with Historic England’s criteria as a positive contributor.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham It is believed that Altrincham’s original street layout was set out in Roman times due to its relationship with Watling Road. This formation then became the basis for Anglo-Saxon field boundaries.1

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The Normans arrived in Cheshire in 1070 and on defeating the Saxon Lords, gifted an estate in the Altrincham area to one of his Barons. The population grew throughout the 13th and 14th centuries and an established medieval town was created with a Royal Charter granted by King Edward I in 1290 and increasing trade and market activities.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The town declined during the Black Death and sources indicate that it remained a declining and deprived town until the 17th century when restored investment of landowners and patrons, chiefly the Earls of Stamford, instigated an increased revenue and subsequent growth.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham In the 18th century the Bridgewater canal connected Altrincham with Manchester, enabling transportation of goods and instigating a wave of development with many medieval buildings being reconstructed in brick.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The 1801 census shows there were 340 houses in the town with the upper and middle classes clustered in the high town and poorer families in the low town in the area around what is now George Street and Goose Green. The area around the site was at yet undeveloped at the start of the 19th century (Figure 5, map regression below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham During the late half of the 1800s the population of Altrincham grew rapidly, almost quadrupling in size; spurred by the arrival of the railway in 1849. This saw the arable farmland to the south and east of the historic commercial centre of Altrincham developed for the first time.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St John’s Church (grade II) was built 1865-6, designed by J. Medland Taylor. The Vicarage to the west of the site, which is no longer in existence, was also designed by Medland Taylor and built around this time (Figure 7). The late 19th century commentators noted that the Church of England had built the church specifically to accommodate the working classes (and counter the local non-conformists) and claimed the title “the poor man’s church”. Having worked to establish a congregation this factor accounts for the later construction of the adjacent primary school, although this was also necessary to meet the requirements of the 1870 Education Act which provided state funding to build new school.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. John’s primary school was built as a National School with part state funding. The ‘National Schools’ movement (‘The National Society for Promoting Religions Education’) had started much earlier in 1811 to promote the education of the poor “in the Principles of the Established Church”, or the Church of England. National Schools paralleled the aims of ‘British Schools’ which were founded on Protestant non-conformist, non-denominational principles in a movement started in 1808. The governing aim of

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham the National Schools was a partial response to non-conformism to try to ensure that, "the National Religion should be made the foundation of National Education and should be the first and chief thing taught to the poor, according to the excellent Liturgy and Catechism provided by our Church”. As a result, the early 19th century churches were often implemented by the local vicar and members of the Church of England and stressed religious education.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Church of England resisted early 19th century attempts for the state to provide secular education. This control changed across the century, and by the last quarter of the century secular education was made compulsory. Most of the currently surviving National schools were finally fully absorbed into the state system under the Butler Act of 1944, but many state primary schools maintain a link to the Church of England, reflecting their historic origins. St. John’s primary school followed this nationwide pattern.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Site, St John’s School, was built in 1876 as the St. John’s National School and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries and the requirements of the education act (Figure 4). The detachment from the church was enhanced with the later construction of the Parish Hall (refer to Figures 6 and 7 below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The construction of the former St John’s School followed the passing of the 1870 Elementary Education Act which required partially state- funded board schools to be set up to provide primary education in areas where existing provision was inadequate. These schools were managed by elected school boards, which often included local church representatives (as remains the case today). The opening of St. John’s primary School coincided with the passing of the Sandon Act in 1876 which finally imposed a legal duty on parents to ensure that their children were educated and had stimulated another surge in school building.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. Johns remained in school use until it was acquired by the NHS in the late 1980s and was comprehensively converted and extended to accommodate the new use. The adjoining former Parish Hall has also been converted to residential use and the church closed in 2017. The school has been subject to a series of adaptions implemented by the NHS accommodate new services, parking and clinical practices continuing into the last decade, prior to the medical practice relocating and the to premises being sold for development in January 2020.

The 1851 census showed these roads harboured artisans, commercials, managers and professional people, and a few people carried out industry in wool, silk and cotton.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The external appearance of the building from the principal façade retains the character that it would have had at the turn of the 20th century but has experienced some alterations which shall be elaborated on this section.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The main difference to the principal facade is the single storey side extension which adjoins the building to the west (Figures 15 and 18). This was granted planning permission on 27th March 1991 (application no. H/32847). Whilst the main materials such as the snecked stone and slate roof are appropriate, the building form, single storey with a mansard-style roof, is slightly at odds with the original building. There are also some roof lights added as part of the 2008 application (application no. 70694).

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation Figure 4 also shows the gable with fine intricate wooden lattice. This is in good condition and, if it is original, appears to have been restored. Behind the lattice the building material appears to be pale, coursed brick, the date of which is unknown. The stonework on the gable below the lattice is discoloured and could benefit from some restoration.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation As seen in Figures 5 with the spire of St John’s Church in the background, the protruding late 19th century gable (greyed-out element in this photograph) shields the main part of the building from the church, effectively intersecting between the site and the heritage asset.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The front elevation is not of great architectural interest, but it retains its original character as a Victorian gothic vernacular building with interesting features such as the wooden lattice and mullion stone windows.

The side extension imitates the design features of the main building such as the mullion windows as shown in Figure 7.

Whilst only partially visible from the public realm it can been seen down the side-access route from the street.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation The photographs of the rear elevation (Figures 9 to Figure 23) show the three additional dormers inserted as part of the 1997 planning permission (application no. H/44360). Despite the use of timber with white infill these dormers do little to respond to the design of the rest of the building and appear oversized in relation to the existing building and the mullion windows below. The rear elevation was always far plainer than the front elevation, lacking the ornate latticework in the gable. The large slate- covered void comprising the lift-plant room visually detracts from the elevation.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation From the north west, the blank façade of the extension in dark coursed brick is even more visible and overrides the material quality and detailing of the stonework on the rear elevation (Figure 10). The small outbuilding comprises a single-storey structure of common-brick bond, established c.1990s.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The building was designed in 1876 as the ‘St. John’s National School’ and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The ground floor was dedicated as the principal space for daily teaching and activities, with ancillary rooms likely used as cloakroom and additional classroom spaces. The central component of the building was divided into two parts, which reflects the usual arrangement of 19th century school buildings, which traditionally allowed for a separate ‘hall’ space for each sex. This arrangement is reflected in the separate playgrounds to the rear (Figure 25, below), which would have been accessed by independent exits to the rear of the building.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR It is thought that the central hall spaces to the ground floor historically comprised a double heighted space, which was later divided c.late 20th century when the building was converted into a medical centre; to create two separate floors. The west wing to the north-west of the building is however, believed to have always comprised of a ground and first floor. The original staircase and timber joists to this part of the building appear to date to the late-19th century and confirm this notion. The west wing of the building retains some evidence of historic fabric including original timber floors and chimney breasts but was extensively altered in the 1980s and again in the early 21st century to facilitate a new use (NHS doctors).

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. Following this, a soft strip exercise was undertaken to remove internal partitions and fixtures of no heritage significance. The soft strip allows for a better understanding of the building’s original plan form and historic components. The survey which has informed the present report (including images) was undertaken in November 2021 following completion of the soft strip.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Whilst no original plans of the building are known to survive, historic mapping from 1876 provides some indication of the general internal layout of the ground floor to the former school building, which was formed of two principal rooms to the centre with smaller rooms to the west wing. The original brick walls (now overpainted) have been retained as part of the soft strip works and better convey the original, open plan form of the central hall spaces which were divided by a single wall. The soft strip has further revealed the original timber floorboards and original corbels which support the trusses above, these would have originally been experienced as a double heighted space; but the insertion of a new floor in the late-20th century / early 21st century has altered this.

Text: Former central halls and classrooms The following section provides a photographic record of the portion of the site believed to have been dedicated as the ‘former girls hall’, as historic mapping indicates direct access was only permitted to the girl’s playground from this part of the building.

Text: Former central halls and classrooms A number of smaller, ancillary rooms were located to the west side of the hall. Whilst no historic plans of the building are known to survive, it is believed these rooms would have been dedicated for additional classroom or cloakroom space.

Text: 5.2 Staircases The building contains two staircases. The original late-19th century staircase, which permitted access to the first floor from the classroom and hall spaces below is located to the north-western corner of the building. The secondary staircase occupies the opposite north-east corner of the building and is a modern addition of no heritage significance.

Text: 5.2.1 Northwest staircase 5.2.1 Northwest staircase

Text: 5.2.1 Northwest staircase The late-19th century staircase situated to the north-west corner of the building originally gave access to the west wing from the ground floor. Whilst no plans of the building are known to survive, the plain appearance of the staircase indicates it was used to provide access from the rear entrance to a teacher’s study or a small office space above. The staircase is very narrow and utilitarian in both form and use of materials.

Text: 5.2.1 Northwest staircase The staircase is formed of a simple ‘U’ shaped design, with a single landing between each floor level. The balustrade and handrails are timber and express minimal architectural detailing. A simple, moulded skirting board also survives.

The staircase does however abut an original wall which forms a common boundary with the Parish Church Hall to the east.

Text: 5.2.2 Northeast staircase Historic mapping indicates the footprint of the building was altered in the late-19th century when the adjacent hall building was erected, meaning the wall was originally an internal wall within the building.

Text: 5.3 First Floor (central hall space) The upper floor levels of the building (above the central hall area) were originally open and formed a double heighted space. The inserted floor within this central space is thus a later addition and of little heritage interest.

Text: 5.3 First Floor (central hall space) The surviving trusses to the roof space do, however, remain fully appreciable and allow for an understanding of the buildings historic character and significant aesthetic appearance. Whilst the inclusion of modern plasterboard and insulation to the first-floor roof space has resulted in some loss of original character, the soft strip has revealed some original brick walling and trusses underneath which allows for a better understanding of the space and original materials.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION This method statement has been compiled by Mount Acre Homes on the instruction of Quinta Group Ltd to set out the proposed methodology for the demolition and reconstruction of the former St. Johns Medical Centre, St. Johns Road, Altrincham.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION The purpose of the proposed methodology is to protect the structural and historic qualities of the retained buildings and in the interests of visual amenity - having regard to Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy and the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION Mount Acre Homes have produced this method statement with reference to good practice and project experience of restoration of historic buildings. The document also refers to the Significance Appraisal and heritage impact assessment undertaken by Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION The former medical centre is a two storey building, built with a combination of facing materials including brick, decorative timber and stone. The external structure is set under a king-pin-joist supported, slate roof. The building was formerly a school before being used as a medical centre and due to its external appearance is considered to contribute to the character of the Conservation Area. Nevertheless, the transformation of the interior means that the former school retains no internal architectural interest. The Heritage significance appraisal concludes the building is a ‘non-designated heritage asset’.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION It is proposed to carefully demolish the rear half of the building (illustrated below) during which roof slates, king pin joists and building stone will be salvaged. It is proposed to incorporate these salvaged materials into the new build component of the scheme, in accordance with approved architectural plans.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION prior to commencement of demolition works a Level 2 Historic Building Survey will be carried out in accordance with the requirements of ‘Understanding Historic Buildings: A Guide to Good Recording Practise’. The survey report will be submitted to the Local Planning Authority.

Text: SECTION 2 - DEMOLITION The Contract Administrator will submit a Section 80 Notice of Intended Demolition to the Local Authority prior to the Works commencing. The Contractor will establish a site compound within the existing temporary car park for welfare and material storage. The compound is enclosed via secured fencing. The demolition works will be undertaken in three phases as follows:

Text: Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal

Text: Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal The building owner commissioned an Asbestos Refurbishment and Demolition Survey by a UKAS accredited Surveyor. All asbestos containing materials have been removed from the entire premises by a licenced contractor in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, HSE Guidance Notes and good practice. These materials were removed from site to a licensed waste facility for processing.

Text: Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out

Text: Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out Internal fixtures and fittings have been stripped from the premises along with internal walls and floors. Waste material was disposed off-site to a licenced waste facility.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Phase 3 – Demolition of Building

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Demolition of building areas, illustrated in planning application approved by Local Authority. Screened access scaffolding will be erected and later dismantled to allow for the separation of the roofs and external walls from the original and adjacent structures. The separation will be by hand via operatives on the scaffolding. The original slate roofs will be stripped by hand with any slates suitable for re-use lowered to ground level and stacked on pallets within the site compound for re-use. The rainwater goods are on the whole not suitable for re-use and will be removed and disposed of.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building The timber roof structure (king pin joists) appear to be in good condition, however the extent of their structural integrity, overall condition, and pitch compatibility for the new roof, cannot be determined due to internal access restrictions. The decorative king pin joists will be

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Planning Reference no: 101163/FUL/20

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building carefully removed, restored if necessary, then safely warehoused on site in preparation for future use.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Demolition of the superstructure will commence from the rear of the building taking down any remaining internal and external walls. The walls will be taken down by hand from the scaffolding with stones cleaned and stacked on pallets for re-use. The ground floors and foundations will be grubbed up by mechanical means and removed from site. Dust suppression will be used as necessary.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building We anticipate from site inspection that some of the original masonry will not be suitable for re-use due to its condition. Where materials cannot be re-used, they will be carefully recorded for reference during the re-construction.

Text: SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS

Text: SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS It is proposed to re-construct part of the roof and rear external facade of the former medical centre using the salvaged materials from the demolition works. Consented architectural plans will be used as the basis for re-reconstruction. Where salvaged material from the original buildings is not available, or its condition is not suitable for re-use, materials will be imported and incorporated on a like for like basis with samples to be agreed with the Planning Officer. New external doors and windows will be installed to the existing openings in accordance with the requirements of the Local Planning Authority. Any materials not re-used during the re- construction works will be recorded and disposed off-site to a licenced waste facility.
