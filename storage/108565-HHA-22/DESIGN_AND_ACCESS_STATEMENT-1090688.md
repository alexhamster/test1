Text: Physical Context 2.2 Design Brief

Text: 3.2 Amount The proposal involves two extensions that are required to provide the better living accommodation for our client.

Text: 3.2 Amount In order to rationalise the ground floor spaces and open up the house to the garden we intend to demolish the existing brick extensions to the rear, replacing them with a new single storey rear extension.

Text: 3.2 Amount To create larger bedrooms at first floor and rationalise the roof plan it is proposed to create a part 2 storey rear extension.

Text: 3.3 Layout At ground floor the proposed single storey rear extension wil span most of the width of the property and contain a new kitchen, dining and lounge space. This will allow increased connectivity between house and garden.

Text: 3.3 Layout Glazed sliding doors both internally and externally help improve the connection from the depth of the house through to the garden whilst roof lights provide natural light deep into the plan.

Text: 3.3 Layout At the base of the new 2 storey extension a new study will face out onto the garden. Above on a reconfigured first floor the bedrooms are increased in size and plan efficiency improved.

Text: 3.5 Scale The property has a rear garden with lawned areas surrounded by planting beds. It is proposed to increase the size of the patio to allow improved use of the garden through the seasons, a sizeable lawned area will remain. The patio will appear as a continuation of the interior.

Text: 3.5 Scale The proposed extensions intend to complement the scale and proportions of the existing property.

Text: 3.5 Scale The single storey extension to the rear has an eaves height of only 3.1m above the garden providing a low level extension.

Text: 3.5 Scale The two storey extension aims to rationalise the roof form and provide unified rear elevation to the house. Therefore it matches both the existing eaves and ridge heights. As result to the front elevation the ridge height is increased and roof line amended again to form a unified roof form.

Text: 3.6 Appearance The extension to the main roof will use matching roof tiles to the existing , the two storey bedroom extension will similarly use matching red brick. This will help these elements pull together with the form of the exisitng house.

Text: 3.6 Appearance To the rear the single storey extension will be finished in a light grey / off white render. This will sit alongside new grey alumnium glazing systems to present a more contemporary garden facing addition to the house.

Text: 3.6 Appearance 4.1 Pedestrian and Vehicular

Text: 3.6 Appearance Pedestrian and vehicular access to the site remain unchanged with off street parking still availble.

Text: 3.6 Appearance Level access into the property currently does not exist, due to the level change at the front door.

Text: 3.6 Appearance 4.2 Waste and Recycling

Text: 3.6 Appearance The existing waste and recycling bins are located at the front and side of the property this will remain unchanged.

Text: 3.6 Appearance The scheme will be designed to meet the revised requirements of Building Regulations Part L. The resulting fabric of the new extensions will have better thermal performance than the extensions it replaces.
