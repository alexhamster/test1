Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.2.1

Text: 1.0 Introduction The existing site is fully developed with impermeable roof and car park areas, and therefore the site can be considered to be fully Brownfield. As such the existing brownfield flow rates from the site have been defined in the table below based on the area of the redevelopment.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3 Geology

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3.1 A detailed site‐specific intrusive investigation has been carried out at the site. This identified shallow made ground over loose brown sand to a maximum depth of 9m BGL. A formal soakaway test was completed three times at the location of the soakaway to the rear of the development. This confirmed the lowest infiltration rate of 2.18x10‐6 m/s.

Text: 1.0 Introduction Figure 3 Soakaway Log at Location of Infiltration Tank

Text: 1.0 Introduction 2.3.2 The results of the investigation were consideranly lower than would be expected of a gravelly sand and the SI company has advised in Figure 4 below that these rates are considered to be poor. Full details can be found in Appendix C.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach Method Suitability Suitability for Development Intrusive site investigations would indicate that the Infiltration to Ground Yes underlying ground is just about suitable for infiltration. Connection to Watercourse No No watercourse in close proximity. Connection to Surface Water Sewer No No surface water sewer in close proximity. Connection to a Combined Sewer No Infiltration option takes precedent.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6 Surface Water Drainage Strategy

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach The SuDS assessment and hierarchal approach discussed in Figure 4 above has defined the overall SuDS strategy. The general principal of the surface water drainage strategy is to collect the runoff from the roof of the residential dwellings the existing and new downpipes. The water will then be directed to a new below ground surface water drainage network that will outfall to a geocellular infiltration tank located in the rear car parking area. The car park area itself will drain to the permeable surfacing located in the parking bays. This approach significantly reduces the runoff from the site to the downstream combined sewer network.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6.1

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6.2

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach To reduce the risk of flooding a high level overflow will be installed on the network that connects back to the combined sewer. This will be set above the level of the infiltration tank.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 2.6.3 A detailed drainage GA drawing and calculations can be found in the Appendices. This has shown no flooding for both the 30‐year and extreme 100 year + 40% climate change event.

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach 3.1 Planning Conditions

Text: 2.5 SuDS Hierarchal Approach Each point of conditions 15 & 16 are listed below in italics with the Brennan Consult response beneath in Blue.

Text: Condition 15 Condition 15

Text: Condition 15 The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced unless and until a scheme to improve the surface water disposal from the site has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be one of the two options listed below and must be in accordance with the drainage hierarchy:

Text: Condition 15 Dwg No. (PL) 018 Rev. A (Infiltration Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 Dwg No. (PL) 018 (Attenuated Drainage Layout)

Text: Condition 15 The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.

Text: Condition 15 The SuDS hierarchal approach has been considered in Section 2. The site investigation has informed that infiltration is viable. An infiltration rate of 2.18x10‐6 has been used and the hydraulic calculations updated using this rate to define the tank size. Overall SuDS will take the form of an infiltration tank and permeable paving.

Text: Condition 15 Refer to Appendix A for the drainage GA and Appendix B for the hydraulic calculations.

Text: Condition 16 Condition 16

Text: Condition 16 The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied unless and until a management and mainte‐ nance plan to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme for the lifetime of the devel‐ opment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The manage‐ ment and maintenance plan shall include the arrangements for adoption by an appropriate public body or statutory undertaker, management and maintenance by a Residents' Management Company or any other arrangements to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme throughout its lifetime. The management and maintenance plan shall be implemented for the lifetime of the de‐ velopment.

Text: Condition 16 The long‐term maintenance of the new private (non adopted) drainage infrastructure will be with the property owners and a maintenance company in line with best practice guidance. Annual inspections will need to be carried out and clearing of drainage chambers, gullies and permeable paving. A separate Management and Maintenance plan has been prepared.

Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: Introduction Groundtech Consulting have been instructed by Quinta to undertake soil percolation testing for a proposed site development located off St John’s Road in Altrincham. Below is a concise SuDS Appraisal in accordance with the agreed scope of works.

Text: Introduction The site was previously occupied by a disused Medical Centre in the southern area with a tarmac car park to the north and an outbuilding in the centre of the car park used for storage.

Text: Introduction The objective of the Ground Investigation was to determine the soil infiltration rates for the proposed development of 5 No. residential buildings and an extension to the current basement.

Text: Site Works Site Works

Text: Site Works Groundtech Consulting visited the site on 2nd September 2022. One machine trial pit (SuDS1) was excavated to a depth of 2.0m bgl. Soil percolation testing was carried out at this location in general accordance with BRE Digest 365.

Text: Site Works The location of the soil percolation test is shown on the Exploratory Hole Location Plan GRO-21262-P07 and the trial pit log is appended.

Text: Made Ground Made Ground

Text: Made Ground Tarmac surfacing was observed from the surface to a depth of 0.08m bgl.

Text: Made Ground The following Made Ground was encountered during the investigation:

Text: Made Ground Black sandy gravel of mixed lithologies including ash and slag was observed to a depth of 0.5m bgl.

Text: Made Ground Brown slightly clayey gravelly sand with gravel of mixed lithologies including brick and slag was observed to a depth of 1.15m bgl.

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) Soil Infiltration Rate (m/sec)

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) The soil percolation tests were performed in the natural gravelly Sand of SuDS1 which was encountered from 1.15m to 2.0m bgl. Water was pumped into the trial pits and three tests were carried out, each lasting for 2 hours with measurements of the water level being taken at regular intervals. The depth of the water did not significantly reduce in the test location, particularly during Test 2 and 3.

Text: Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) Soil infiltration rates of 2.18 x 10-6 m/s and 8.55 x 10-6 m/s have been calculated which indicate poor drainage conditions exist within the underlying natural soils.

The potential exists for ground conditions to be encountered which are different to those considered in this Report, particularly between exploratory holes. The extent of the limited area depends on the soil and groundwater conditions, together with other constraints such as the position of any existing structures and underground utilities. If so stipulated in the Agreement, geo-environmental testing was carried out for a limited number of parameters based on an understanding of the available operational and historical information, and it should not be inferred that other chemical species are not present.

Text: GRO-21262-3878 ST JOHNS ROAD, ALTRINCHAM SUDS APPRAISAL Any groundwater conditions entered on the exploratory hole records are those observed at the time of investigation. The groundwater level often has not had time to reach equilibrium and a monitoring period is required. Furthermore, groundwater levels are subject to seasonal variation or changes in local drainage conditions and groundwater levels may occur at other times of the year which are higher than were recorded during this investigation.
