Text: 1.1 Experienced subcontractors under the supervisor of McGoff Construction Limited (MCL) on behalf of the owner will undertake Works on site.

Text: 1.1 Operatives conducting the deconstruction works will report to the site project manager to receive a full site induction including clear explanation as the conservation approach to the façade works.

Text: 1.1 All method statements, risk assessments and the Blackett-Ord report will be read fully understood and signed before all works commence.

Text: 1.2 1.2

Text: 1.2 The works will be conducted on the public footpath on Railway Road in combination with access from inside the site to enable a safe system of works and observing the conservation matters contained within the Blackett-Ord report.

Text: 1.3 1.3

Text: 1.3 An application to close the public footpath and adjacent road has been submitted to the LA by Amberon traffic management on behalf of MCL as the plan contained in Appendix B, Mr Ian Elliot (LA) in his email

Text: 1.3 Dated 15th July 2022 confirmed this was acceptable and therefore could be put in place.

Text: 1.4 1.4

Text: 1.4 Before works commence the footpath and road closure area will be set up therefore cordoning off the work area from the public and maintain complete segregation whilst the works are carried out.

Text: 1.5 1.5

Text: 1.5 A general-purpose access scaffold will then be erected within the footpath closure to afford operatives access to remove signage etc. therefore exposing the existing brickwork. A qualified electrician will then isolate any lighting etc. on the façade and remove from site.

Text: 1.6 1.6

Text: 1.6 The timber wall plates will need to be removed in the first instance, this will be effected via a hydraulic MEWP & scaffold access, once the timber wall plates have been removed, the facade brickwork will then be dismantled by hand starting from the top down.

Text: 1.6 In the top down approach to dismantling the wall, operatives should only work from a level partially above the loose bricks and there should be no site personnel at ground level in the vicinity of the works. This will be part of the briefing to operatives / sub-contractors.

Text: 1.6 This is also important to determine how released /loose bricks will be passed off the scaffolding to ground level and therefore the live load design of the scaffold working platforms and / or the MEWP capacity.

Text: 1.6 Each course of brickwork will be cleaned, palletised, shrink wrapped & labelled up then transferred onto site where it will be stored in a dry place, this methodology will be constantly repeated whilst the deconstruction team will be conducting regular visual checks on the wall as the height reduces during the process.

Text: 1.7 1.7

Text: 1.7 Regular checks will be conducted by MCL site management monitoring any potential vulnerabilities appearing in the wall during the dismantle process.

Text: 1.7 Next to the adjoining building (Double Tree restaurant) which is not a party wall, there is an existing double skin wall that is connected at the interface of the façade wall on Railway Street, this has been left in position to support the façade wall, this will also need to be dismantled by hand including the chimney breasts and will need to run in line with the dismantling works to the façade wall.

Text: 1.7 At all times on the gable wall dismantle, diagonal support lines will be maintained to assist in keeping the integrity of support at the interface section of both walls.

Text: 1.7 When working on the reduction of the side gable wall and remaining chimneybreasts it is worth noting that structural matters resulting from the first floor removal and the fractured / incomplete nature of the stone hearths. Removal of bricks may require mechanical means, It is therefore worth noting that the voids could be filled with brick and once the risk of loose bricks from above has been removed from both the front elevation and the side wall the risk of soot damage / dilute sulphuric acid within the flue will also reduce this may mean less dismantling to the sidewall than the front wall.

Text: 1.7 1.8

Text: 1.7 To the rear of the façade wall there is also raked brick walls offering support, as the façade is reduced these supporting raked walls will also be dismantled top down running in line with the reduced height of the façade thus affording lateral support during the works.

Text: 1.7 During the dismantling of the façade at the point where the works become coincidental with lintel these will be inspected by a consultant engineer to establish if they are still fit for purpose and if not these will be removed and replaced with new lintels designed by the engineer and introduced during reconstruction.

Text: 1.7 In accordance with the Blackett-Ord report the façade wall will be reduced in height sequentially to a level were the integrity of the wall increases sufficiently to allow it to be safely inspected by a consultant engineer. The engineer’s inspection will determine adequate stability of the remaining wall that could then be retained and receive upon it the reconstruction of the façade to its original height and detailing.

Text: 1.7 All works incorporated with the double skin wall next to the restaurant will be notifiable to the property owner and if necessary communicated daily as part of the progress reports that will be undertaken.

Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: Introduction This structural conservation engineering report has been prepared in response to instructions received from Consensus Property Limited. The agreed brief was as follows:

Text: Introduction Visit the property and undertake a non-intrusive visual inspection from ground level of those parts of the property that are deemed safe to access.

Text: Introduction Review current engineering proposals, based upon the current condition of the building.

Text: Introduction Prepare a report providing our advice on the way forward, giving just regard to the property being within a conservation area, but not statutory listed, or locally listed.

Text: Introduction Trafford Council have issued a Section 77 Notice dated 08th April 2022, to obviate danger and ensure the safety of the chimney stack and front façade. Removal of the stacks and the upper part of the gable wall has been responded to and completed. The proposed action in respect of the façade has not yet reached an agreement with the Authority as to the scope of works necessary.

Text: Introduction Access to undertake our visual inspection was provided to us on 16th May 2022. Our inspection was visual, non-intrusive and undertaken on foot. We consider this to be entirely appropriate as concerns are held by both the Council and the Contractor that what currently remains of the structure is unsafe. A view we shared when on site. It is our experience that working in close proximity to a partially dismantled structure needs to be approached with the up most care and regard to health and safety. As such we regularly use our knowledge of the construction of similar buildings of similar age and our experience of their hidden condition and make a balanced decision.

Text: Introduction We also had the benefit of recent aerial photographs to assist our inspection planning, decision making and thought processes.

Text: Introduction As CARE registered engineers we understand the relevant Heritage legislation and policies and the resulting need to minimise any intervention and airing towards retention when considered feasible. We regularly provide advice on sensitive buildings for both public and private sector clients.

Text: Introduction This report has been prepared for the sole use of Consensus Property Limited, their agents and appointed professionals. It is not to be relied upon by any third party and shall not be distributed to other parties, other than statutory authorities, funders, or insurers, without the consent of Blackett-Ord Conservation Ltd.

Text: Historical Background Historical Background

Text: Historical Background The building, formerly a public house is located just outside The Downs Conservation Area and the Character Zone B, known as The Downs Commercial Area. (Ref:

Text: Historical Background Trafford Council Conservation Area Appraisal – October 2014 and the Trafford Council Conservation Area Management Plan – March 2016.). It does however sit within the boundary of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. (Ref: Trafford documents of the same dates.).

Text: Historical Background 46 Railway Street appears on tithe plans, between 1835 and 1852. Prior to this there was a more narrower building at the front of the plot. The double fronted two storey building, with basement, and a side access to the rear yard, was known as The Downs Hotel. Prior to being painted the front elevation would have matched attachent exposed brick elevations with low rise arched window heads and stone cills. The hotel later became a public house.

Text: Historical Background Blackett-Ord Conservation Engineering

Text: Historical Background 4

Text: Historical Background The Conservation Area Appraisal considers the building a landmark and providing a positive contribution to the Conservation Area. The elevation visible in the image above is currently covered by a site advertising hoarding.

Text: Historical Background More recently, and prior to our appointment, a previous contractor has removed the roof, the first flloor, ground flloor, internal walls and rear wall of the building. The basement has also been filled with polystyrene blocks to ground level. This has left the front elevation without adequate lateral restraint.

Text: Structural Observations Structural Observations

Text: General Structural Form General Structural Form

Text: General Structural Form From what remains of the building and from our knowledge of traditional buildings of this date, we would describe the original structural form as loadbearing brick under a pitched timber and slated roof, with timber first and ground floors.

Text: General Structural Form Whilst the building would appear to have been present since circa 1835, it was not constructed to an exceptional standard, representing common construction techniques of the time. Also, it has not remained unaltered. This is often the case with buildings that provide a community function and there is evidence of previous interventions and changes. Some of which resulted in the removal of the cellular robustness of the original building, with not all changes being coordinated or providing continuity of the structural form or sympathetic aesthetics of the façade.

Text: General Structural Form The occupational use as a hotel and a public house suggests that the missing internal configuration of the property would have undergone periodic ad hoc alteration to adapt to changing needs and customer expectations over time. We have seen previously these can lead to structural discontinuity and weaknesses. What was evident from our inspection of the rear of the façade is that what remains of the righthand wall, is a modern cavity wall with galvanised twisted wire ties. This is not an original nineteenth century construction and is indicative of significant past changes to the building. It is our view that this wall does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. Visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster reinforces this opinion

Text: General Structural Form At the middle of the building there is a single 102mm thick brick wall that does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. There is also visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster as well as a tapering gap between the wall and the rear of the facade.

Text: General Structural Form At the left hand side there are separate walls forming the boundary between the two properties. There is a tapering gap between these two walls, that was approximately 125mm at slate level. Both walls appear to be 225mm thick. The wall for the adjoining property presents as stretcher bond bringing into question whether it is structurally stable under wind loading.

Text: General Structural Form Our experience of similar nineteenth century buildings of this size and construction suggests we should consider the presence of timber lintols behind the low rise brick arch lintols. Potentially, also of consideration, is the common use of bonding timbers built into the inner wall face at corners and cross walls. All of which become

Text: General Structural Form Blackett-Ord Conservation Engineering

Text: General Structural Form 5

Text: General Structural Form problematic when they decay and effectively reduce the thickness of the wall. The presence of these could not be verified due to areas of internal dry lining.

Text: General Structural Form From the historic mapping and the evident different dates of construction materials, it is possible that at first floor and roof of the Hotel passed over the alleyway to the rear courtyard. With the alleyway being one bay remote from the bank building. This would suggest that some time prior to the Conservation Area appraisal a considerable part of this building was lost due to alterations. Furthermore, alterations to the elevation have been made including the installation of Upvc windows.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed Residual Structural Issues Observed

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The following residual structural issues were observed from ground level from within the footprint of what now remains of the original building:

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The lowered gable wall with the adjacent property has some loose brickwork.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The chimney breasts that remain change size over their height and at first floor level (and possibly ground floor level) parts of the brickwork are supported on timber joists and stone flags.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The construction and stability of the exposed gable wall of the adjoining property is undetermined. Visually the brickwork appears to be stretcher bond and as such it is not known whether this adjacent wall is 112mm thick or greater. At present it is susceptible to high wind loadings that it may not be capable of sustaining. It appears to be the case that each adjacent property has its own wall, the removal of the gable wall will allow the neighbouring property to inspect their wall and undertake any remedial works necessary.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed There appears to be two rows of timber wall plate at the top of the front façade, one where the roof jack rafters connected (upper) and open at the head of the first-floor windows. (lower). This lower wall plate may act as a timber lintol over the first-floor windows. Timber internal lintol and brick voussoir arch externally.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The brickwork above the lower wall plate appears to be 225mm thick and below the wall plate 327mm thick. The change in thickness occurring at the first-floor window head level. The timber wall plate appears to be decayed.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The removal of the first-floor timber joists has left pockets in the façade, sufficiently above the ground floor window heads to suggest that there may be an internal timber lintol present above and behind the brick voussoirs.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The brick arch behind the sandstone arch lintol above the central main entrance door, is above the level of the first floor, but there appears to be timber still built into the wall thickness.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed Prior to the removal of the building, there is evidence that would suggest that water entry into the building had been occurring for a prolonged period of time. What remains of internal plaster and brickwork has evidence of vegetation growth. When we examined the bricks that were being retained it was apparent that where original mortar was lime, the mortar had freely de- bonded from the clay brick. This would indicate that water saturation of the walls had resulted in the degrading (de-carbonation) of the lime mortar.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed Bricks that had come from the lowered chimney stacks were heavily sooted and cracked, suggesting a combination of heat fractures and sulphate

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed contents that could be harmful. These flue bricks should not be reused in the building.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed Both cross walls that remain do not provide adequate restraint to the front façade wall. Diagonal cracking evident in the remaining plaster and tapering gaps at their junction with the front wall are indicative of overstressing and movement.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The overall thickness of the front façade wall was undeterminable because internally it is lined with boarding and timber stud and externally it is covered with an advertising hoarding.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The condition of the basement structure is unknow as it is filled with polystyrene blocks. We were advised that asbestos-based products may remain in the basement. The basement would have been utilised as the beer cellar and as such we would expect both barrel drops and coal holes to be present from the public pavement level to the basement. These could not be identified internally due to the filling nor externally due to changes in the public realm surfacing. Experience tells us that these are local risks to the integrity of the wall, often caused by corrosion of embedded metalwork.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed From the historic mapping, where the single storey building has been removed was probably the entrance to the rear yard. Certainly, brickwork in all walls is more modern. The opening into the yard with the concrete lintol, was we would suggest originally another building, possibly outbuildings associated with the hotel along the wall of the adjacent bank building. The lintol is likely to be at the end of its design life and unsuitable for any increase dead weight being added above it.

Text: Residual Structural Issues Observed The junction with the ‘Bank’ building may be considered as a Party Wall scenario.

Text: Options Type of Intervention Issues Do nothing This would be in breach of the Section 77 Notice. It would not address future deterioration of the structure. It would not make the remaining structure safe or enable a safe working environment to be developed. It would continue to be a risk to the general public. Undertake further survey work. This would breach the timescales set in the Section 77 notice. A verticality check would not negate the overriding lack of bond between mortar and bricks. Dimensional survey could be undertaken during dismantling to assist in rebuilding but would not add to the decision-making process that is

Demolition of the façade. overridden by condition rather than deformation of the façade. Mortar testing can be useful in deciding on the mix of the mortar to use in reconstruction, but will not inform the mortar condition, which will be variable and different in different locations. Further surveys would result in the structure remaining exposed to the elements and continue to deteriorate. Adds no additional information to what has already been seen and assessed from experience. Requires the removal of the front hoarding. Requires the partial removal of internal drylining to expose the rear face of the brick wall. Even if this could be done safely, in our view there is insufficient remaining cross walls that are in themselves weak and lacking adequate support. Vibration from the installation could dislodge un- bonded brickwork risking uncontrolled collapse. The depth of the basement cannot be safely confirmed as the vibration from ground investigation / installation of shores could dislodge un-bonded brickwork. The condition of the basement retaining walls cannot be safely verified. The ground conditions below the basement level cannot be safely investigated. Same issues as the internal façade retention system plus - The extensive safe working zone required would result in the closure of the whole junction. - Likely result in delays and prolongation of risk and deterioration of condition. Un-controlled demolition from a distance could result in unknown modes of wall failure due to the variable loss of bonding between bricks and their mortar.

Text: Recommendations Recommendations

Text: Recommendations The structural situation that has been left by others would normally suggest the need for a façade retention system. Structurally this should have been designed and erected prior to the removal of the roof, floors, and parts of the cross walls. It would have also been possible at that time to design a system that minimised the disruption to the public realm, by being erected almost entirely from within the footprint of the building.

Text: Recommendations Whether the façade has moved, is moving, or not moving does not change the fact that it is inadequately restrained and of undeterminable structural integrity. Monitoring the façade will not add knowledge to this or inform or alter the situation currently presenting. Neither is it necessary to consider the precise angle of the façade as observations confirm it is unsafe, and this is not contested by the Council (evidenced by the s77).

Text: Recommendations Likewise, it is apparent that the gable wall has moved historically and is also currently compromised by the changes in wall profile being supported on the remains of timbers and fractured stone fire hearths.

Text: Recommendations Fundamentally a safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade. There are too many unmanageable risks to even allow sufficient investigations to be undertaken into ground conditions and basement construction to design such a system.

Text: Recommendations From both a safety and structural viewpoint the recommended action now needed is to continue to dismantle the building by hand from remote hydraulic platforms. Dismantling from the top down we see as being progressive and if the integrity of the wall is found to become more robust at a lower level, then dismantling could cease. From a conservation engineering viewpoint this could be achieved following a dynamic recording of the dimensions, details and materials of the façade together with salvaging suitable materials for future reuse. It also ensures that the minimum amount of historic fabric is lost.

Text: Recommendations We have proposed and successfully delivered several similar projects within busy city centre environments, as well as rural settings, when a brick wall has been exposed to prolonged weathering and internal cross wall restraint to it has been compromised or lost due to decay in floors, or embedded timbers. We have also found that once a sound level has been reached, there is no need to provide façade retention, providing subsequent works are progressed in a timely manner and the wall is then tied into the new works.

The wall for the adjoining property presents as stretcher bond bringing into question whether it is structurally stable under wind loading.

Potentially, also of consideration, is the common use of bonding timbers built into the inner wall face at corners and cross walls. All of which become problematic when they decay and effectively reduce the thickness of the wall. The presence of these could not be verified due to areas of internal dry lining.

Text: Appendix 1 8) The brickwork above the lower wall plate appears to be 225mm thick and below the wall plate 327mm thick. The change in thickness occurring at the first-floor window head level. The timber wall plate appears to be decayed.

Text: Appendix 1 9) The removal of the first-floor timber joists has left pockets in the façade, sufficiently above the ground floor window heads to suggest that there may be an internal timber lintol present above and behind the brick voussoirs.

Text: Appendix 1 10) The brick arch behind the sandstone arch lintol above the central main entrance door, is above the level of the first floor, but there appears to be timber still built into the wall thickness.

Text: Appendix 1 11) Prior to the removal of the building, there is evidence that would suggest that water entry into the building had been occurring for a prolonged period of time. What remains of internal plaster and brickwork has evidence of vegetation growth. When we examined the bricks that were being retained it was apparent that where original mortar was lime, the mortar had freely de- bonded from the clay brick. This would indicate that water saturation of the walls had resulted in the degrading (de-carbonation) of the lime mortar.

Text: Appendix 1 12) Both cross walls that remain do not provide adequate restraint to the front façade wall. Diagonal cracking evident in the remaining plaster and tapering gaps at their junction with the front wall are indicative of overstressing and movement.

Text: Appendix 1 13) The condition of the basement structure is unknown as it is filled with polystyrene blocks. We were advised that asbestos-based products may remain in the basement. The basement would have been utilised as the beer cellar and as such we would expect both barrel drops and coal holes to be present from the public pavement level to the basement. These could not be identified internally due to the filling nor externally due to changes in the public realm surfacing. Experience tells us that these are local risks to the integrity of the wall, often caused by corrosion of embedded metalwork.

Text: Appendix 1 14) Fundamentally a safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade. There are too many unmanageable risks to even allow sufficient investigations to be undertaken into ground conditions and basement construction to design such a system.
