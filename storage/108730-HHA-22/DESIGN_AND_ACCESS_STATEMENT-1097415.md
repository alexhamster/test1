Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate The special historic interest of Dunham Town is linked with the history of the Dunham Massey Estate, which borders the Dunham Town Conservation Area directly to the south; its historic kitchen garden is located within the Conservation Area.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey is situated c.1.5km west of Bowdon in an area of agricultural land. The 100ha park is surrounded by a brick wall which was built 1748-51.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey contains a 17th-century deer park which was remodelled with formal park landscaping from the late-17th to the mid-18th century. It is now a country park enclosing ornamental gardens and is owned by the National Trust.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate In the late 20th Century, a bypass to the village of Dunham was constructed and the wall was rebuilt along the line of the new road between Charcoal Lane and Woodhouse Lane. The wood adjacent to the site was originally part of the estate and still owned by the National Trust

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey Hall is the principal building within the estate and is Grade | listed. It is now a National Trust property and open to the public.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate The building is situated towards the north end of the park. A house was constructed by Sir George Booth on a moated platform in the early part of the C17, probably on or close to the site of an existing building, and this was completed towards the middle of the century.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Gardens are situated on the north, east and south sides of the Hall.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Dunham Town Conservation Area

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Dunham Town is one of the estate villages which historically provided accommodation for the estate’s workers and tenant farmers.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The architectural diversity of the residential buildings in the area ranges from modest terraced cottages to large detached houses. The historic red brick workers’ cottages are characteristically compact in scale with modest, simple detailing.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Their overall form and appearance has generally changed very little, despite several instances of merging and dividing the buildings internally. This has had some impact on the external appearance and adds to the pleasant patina of age.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The varied arrangement of the buildings - some fronting directly onto the street and others being set further back and sometimes overlapping or at an angle - is indicative of the historic development of the village. The sizes of cottages vary depending on their age: the older buildings originally being slightly smaller and terraced.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The larger houses in the Conservation Area conform to a similar good-quality, modest detail standard.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The group comprising lvy House, The Red House and Big Tree House (located near the site) are especially notable as a concentrated group of these larger buildings, all of which date from a period between the early 18th and mid-19th century when a series of detached houses were constructed across the Dunham Massey estate. The National Trust Stamford Estate houses continue the tradition of uniform paint colours and signage.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Park End is one of only six buildings cosntructed after 1898.

Text: 26 The existing house Park end is one two semi detached houses, situated on Charcoal Road that date to the early 20th century and typical of that era. They stand apart from other neighbouring buildings in the village, that follow a more traditional red brick workers cottage style. Neither property is listed.

Text: 26 The existing house The existing building for both properties has been extended at some point.

Text: 26 The existing house The extension of Park End is some what unsympathetic with a felt flat roof. The single storey to the rear, is positioned so that it leaves a dark internal courtyard, blocking daylight and garden views to the existing kitchen.

Text: 26 The existing house The large windows to the current extension are in poor state and in need of replacement.

Text: 26 The existing house At some point the existing porch has been in filled to make internal.

Text: 3 Design 31 The brief

Text: 3 Design The proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims;

Text: 3 Design * To sympathetically restore the front of the house, and reflect the neighbours property that has been more sympathetically altered.

Text: 3 Design ¢ To allow the rear of the house to benefit from the garden, and solar gains

Text: 3 Design ¢ Provide a family home that can adapt to future requirements, preventing further alterations.

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front . 3.2 Restoring the front

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The intention would be to replace the flat felt roof with a pitched slate roof. The pitched roof is felt to be more in keeping with the original property and tie in better with the neighbouring dwelling (The Gables).

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The current property has a small integral garage, which is too small to accommodate today’s car. It is proposed to convert this as living space and replace the metal garage door with a timber window designed to be in keeping with the rest of the facade.

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The applicant would also like to restore the front porch to how it would have been originally, again matching the neighbours property.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) 3.3 Creating a family home and maximise daylight and views.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The existing kitchen is positioned in the darkest part of the house. The proposal therefore is to make the existing kitchen a utility space and move the kitchen to the centre of the house where it can act as a hub and benefit from direct access and views of the garden.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) To benefit this further it is proposed to convert the current garage space to an open plan family space. This again will benefit from a new double door allowing access to the garden and maximising on daylight.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) It is proposed to replace the poorly designed single storey rear extension on the same footprint, and incorporate the internal courtyard. Whilst the footprint would increase (7%), the increase is an element that is currently not externally visible.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The proposed extension has been designed to incorporate and respect the current outbuilding. Recognising it as part of the original house setting.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) 3.5 Scale & Massing

Text: 3 Design (cont.) Whilst the proposals seeks to increase the roof space, this is only proposed to improve appearance and the conservation area setting.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The extension to the rear remains as a single storey, but again replaces the flat felt roof with a pitched roof to be more in keeping with original property whilst providing a contemporary solution.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) Whilst the proposals also seek to incorporate the redundant concealed external space outside the kitchen, this would not increase the overall massing appearance, only visible form the private rear garden.

Text: 4 Access The proposed access arrangements to the property are similar to the existing.

Text: 4 Access The main pedestrian and vehicular access into the property remains as existing; via the driveway that is accessed from Charcoal Lane.

Text: 4 Access The existing drive is unchanged and can comfortably accommodate three vehicles.

Text: 4 Access To the rear of the property, the existing doors are amended to give better and visible access to the garden from all rear combined living spaces but remain in the same location as the existing.

Text: 4 Access A downstairs cloakroom is proposed to be accommodated, which will be in-line with current building regulations and provide an accessible WC to visitors and residents of the property.

Text: 4 Access The addition of a study provides the resident with the option to work from home and reduce fuel usage.

Text: 5 Green Belt Statement 5 Green Belt Statement

Text: 5 Green Belt Statement The proposed extension and house are situated within the Green Belt. National planning policy is produced to ensure development does not have a detrimental impact upon the green belt.

Text: 5 Green Belt Statement Policy C5 - Development in the Green Belt, States that development within the Green Belt will not be allowed unless it is set out in one of four purposes, one of which is, ‘The limited extension, alteration or replacement of existing dwellings’.

Text: 5 Green Belt Statement The proposals seek to reinstate a pitched roof in order to improve the overall appearance and provide a positive impact on the green belt and surrounding area character.

Text: 5 Green Belt Statement It also seeks to remove an unsympathetic single storey extension to the rear and replace with a limited extension that does not visibly extend past the existing extension footprint. Any incrementation is in the location of a concealed internal courtyard.
