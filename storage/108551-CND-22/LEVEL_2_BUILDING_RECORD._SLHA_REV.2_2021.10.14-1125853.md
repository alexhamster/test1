Text: 1.1 Purpose 1.1 Purpose

Text: 1.1 Purpose In October 2021, Heritage Architecture Ltd (HA) were commissioned by the Quinta Group to provide a Level 2 historic building record of St Johns Medical Centre, Altrincham, Trafford (Figure 1, below).

Text: 1.1 Purpose The building has been identified by the Local Planning Authority (LPA), Trafford Council (TC) as ‘non- designated heritage asset’ (NDHA) and is situated within the Downs Conservation Area, Altrincham. Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. There are a number of conditions attached to the consented application, with Conditions 3 and 4 relating to the need for a Historic Building Record (HBR; Condition 3) and an accompanying method statement (Condition 4).

Text: 1.1 Purpose excluded from the site / proposals. Source: site visit, November 2021.

Text: 1.1 Purpose The purpose of the following report is to provide a Level 2 Historic Building Record of the building in order to discharge Condition 3, which states that:

Text: 1.1 Purpose “No development, including demolition, shall take place until a detailed survey and photographic record in accordance with Level 2 of Historic England's Understanding Historic Buildings: A Guide to Good Recording Practice (2016) of the structures to be demolished has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A copy of the report shall also be deposited with the Greater Manchester Historic Environment Record and Trafford Local Studies Library”.

Text: 1.1 Purpose This report consequently provides a Historic Building Record, meeting the standards established by Historic England for a Level 2 record, as agreed with Trafford Council, in order to support the Planning application for the refurbishment/alteration of the building. This accords with the requirements of the NPPF (2021, para.192 and 205).

Text: 1.2 Methodology The below survey has been completed to a Level 2 standard, as described in Historic England’s document ‘Understanding Historic Buildings: a guide to good record practice’. It involves a full survey of the St Johns Medical Centre, which is to be developed into a residential scheme under the consented proposals.

Text: 1.3.1 Historical research and descriptions The following report is further supplemented by non-intrusive, on-site surveys which have informed the significance appraisal of the site, as outlined within the original Heritage Statement report (Issued: 26 June 2020 - Heritage Architecture Ltd).

Text: 1.3.2 Written record 1.3.2 Written record

Text: 1.3.2 Written record This survey follows Historic England’s guidance set out in Understanding Historic Buildings, a guide to good recording practice (2006). This essentially forms a descriptive record of the site. Under the Level 2 recording guidance; Historic England explains the extent of the approach of the record, that:

Text: 1.3.2 Written record “May be made of a building which is judged not to require any fuller record, or it may serve to gather data for a wider project. Both the exterior and the interior will be viewed, described and photographed. The record will present conclusions regarding the building’s development and use, but will not discuss in detail the evidence on which these conclusions are based. A plan and sometimes other drawings may be made but the drawn record will normally not be comprehensive and may be tailored to the scope of a wider project”

Text: 1.3.2 Written record As such, a descriptive record has been compiled of typical, and key room types and features covering both the interior and exterior of the building, which is accompanied by general and detailed photographs where necessary. The descriptions comment on construction, materials, architectural details, original uses and likely dates/phasing. Areas which have been subject to alteration / modernisation are also identified within the present report.

Text: 1.3.2 Written record The survey of the former medical centre is arranged by floor level, starting with the ground floor and concluding at the roof level. Key areas of the building, such as staircases, are grouped together.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre is located within the Downs Conservation Area in Altrincham, under the jurisdiction of Trafford District Council. As shown in Figure 2 below, the Site sits to the east of a series of 20th century maisonettes, this development has taken the place of the former St John’s Vicarage.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations There is an adjoining wing to the east of the building which has steep pitched roof running at a perpendicular angle to the main elements of the medical centre building. This was constructed added to the main building later in the 19th century as an additional hall. This wing is not under the same ownership and is now in use as dwellings. Further east of the site is the grade II listed Church of St John the Evangelist ‘St John’s Church’, designed by J. Medland Taylor, 1865-6.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations St John’s Medical Centre was constructed as St John’s School in 1876. It is asserted within the Heritage Statement report (Issued: June 2020) that the former school and grade II listed St John’s Church are disassociated, and the school does not fall within the curtilage of the statutory listed heritage asset.

Text: 2.1 Location and Statutory Designations As demonstrated in Figure 3 (below), the site is situated within the Downs CA and was first designated on 8th February 1973 and has been extended three times since. St Johns Medical Centre is located within Character Zone C: The Downs Southeast Area of the Downs Conservation Area and together with St John’s Mews is identified in line with Historic England’s criteria as a positive contributor.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham It is believed that Altrincham’s original street layout was set out in Roman times due to its relationship with Watling Road. This formation then became the basis for Anglo-Saxon field boundaries.1

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The Normans arrived in Cheshire in 1070 and on defeating the Saxon Lords, gifted an estate in the Altrincham area to one of his Barons. The population grew throughout the 13th and 14th centuries and an established medieval town was created with a Royal Charter granted by King Edward I in 1290 and increasing trade and market activities.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The town declined during the Black Death and sources indicate that it remained a declining and deprived town until the 17th century when restored investment of landowners and patrons, chiefly the Earls of Stamford, instigated an increased revenue and subsequent growth.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham In the 18th century the Bridgewater canal connected Altrincham with Manchester, enabling transportation of goods and instigating a wave of development with many medieval buildings being reconstructed in brick.

Text: 3.1 Brief History of Altrincham The 1801 census shows there were 340 houses in the town with the upper and middle classes clustered in the high town and poorer families in the low town in the area around what is now George Street and Goose Green. The area around the site was at yet undeveloped at the start of the 19th century (Figure 5, map regression below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham During the late half of the 1800s the population of Altrincham grew rapidly, almost quadrupling in size; spurred by the arrival of the railway in 1849. This saw the arable farmland to the south and east of the historic commercial centre of Altrincham developed for the first time.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St John’s Church (grade II) was built 1865-6, designed by J. Medland Taylor. The Vicarage to the west of the site, which is no longer in existence, was also designed by Medland Taylor and built around this time (Figure 7). The late 19th century commentators noted that the Church of England had built the church specifically to accommodate the working classes (and counter the local non-conformists) and claimed the title “the poor man’s church”. Having worked to establish a congregation this factor accounts for the later construction of the adjacent primary school, although this was also necessary to meet the requirements of the 1870 Education Act which provided state funding to build new school.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. John’s primary school was built as a National School with part state funding. The ‘National Schools’ movement (‘The National Society for Promoting Religions Education’) had started much earlier in 1811 to promote the education of the poor “in the Principles of the Established Church”, or the Church of England. National Schools paralleled the aims of ‘British Schools’ which were founded on Protestant non-conformist, non-denominational principles in a movement started in 1808. The governing aim of

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham the National Schools was a partial response to non-conformism to try to ensure that, "the National Religion should be made the foundation of National Education and should be the first and chief thing taught to the poor, according to the excellent Liturgy and Catechism provided by our Church”. As a result, the early 19th century churches were often implemented by the local vicar and members of the Church of England and stressed religious education.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Church of England resisted early 19th century attempts for the state to provide secular education. This control changed across the century, and by the last quarter of the century secular education was made compulsory. Most of the currently surviving National schools were finally fully absorbed into the state system under the Butler Act of 1944, but many state primary schools maintain a link to the Church of England, reflecting their historic origins. St. John’s primary school followed this nationwide pattern.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The Site, St John’s School, was built in 1876 as the St. John’s National School and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries and the requirements of the education act (Figure 4). The detachment from the church was enhanced with the later construction of the Parish Hall (refer to Figures 6 and 7 below).

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham The construction of the former St John’s School followed the passing of the 1870 Elementary Education Act which required partially state- funded board schools to be set up to provide primary education in areas where existing provision was inadequate. These schools were managed by elected school boards, which often included local church representatives (as remains the case today). The opening of St. John’s primary School coincided with the passing of the Sandon Act in 1876 which finally imposed a legal duty on parents to ensure that their children were educated and had stimulated another surge in school building.

Text: 3.2 History of St John’s School, Altrincham St. Johns remained in school use until it was acquired by the NHS in the late 1980s and was comprehensively converted and extended to accommodate the new use. The adjoining former Parish Hall has also been converted to residential use and the church closed in 2017. The school has been subject to a series of adaptions implemented by the NHS accommodate new services, parking and clinical practices continuing into the last decade, prior to the medical practice relocating and the to premises being sold for development in January 2020.

The mid-19th century maps shows the area in which the site now stands remained undeveloped land until the middle of the 19th century. The overall site originally formed the farmstead of Goralsgate Farm. Part of the land was occupied at one stage by John Douglas as a joiner’s workshop and timber yard.

The mid-19th century map illustrates housing had begun to develop in the land just north of the Downs, with fashionable Victorian Terraces evident. The 1851 census showed these roads harboured artisans, commercials, managers and professional people, and a few people carried out industry in wool, silk and cotton.

The school contained two separate playgrounds to the rear (girls to the west and boys to the east).

The only notable change is the creation of the outbuilding at the rear, a version of which remains today. It is worth noting that the vicarage is still visible in this map to the west of the site (Figure 9).

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The external appearance of the building from the principal façade retains the character that it would have had at the turn of the 20th century but has experienced some alterations which shall be elaborated on this section.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The main difference to the principal facade is the single storey side extension which adjoins the building to the west (Figures 15 and 18). This was granted planning permission on 27th March 1991 (application no. H/32847). Whilst the main materials such as the snecked stone and slate roof are appropriate, the building form, single storey with a mansard-style roof, is slightly at odds with the original building. There are also some roof lights added as part of the 2008 application (application no. 70694).

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation Figure 4 also shows the gable with fine intricate wooden lattice. This is in good condition and, if it is original, appears to have been restored. Behind the lattice the building material appears to be pale, coursed brick, the date of which is unknown. The stonework on the gable below the lattice is discoloured and could benefit from some restoration.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation As seen in Figures 5 with the spire of St John’s Church in the background, the protruding late 19th century gable (greyed-out element in this photograph) shields the main part of the building from the church, effectively intersecting between the site and the heritage asset.

Text: 4.1 South – St. Johns Street Elevation The front elevation is not of great architectural interest, but it retains its original character as a Victorian gothic vernacular building with interesting features such as the wooden lattice and mullion stone windows.

Text: 4.2 West Elevation The entirety of the west (side) elevation is not original (with regards to plan form) and was extensively altered in the late-20th century (application no. H/32847), this is clearly visible in the aerial photograph (Error! Reference source not found.). The side extension imitates the design features of the main building such as the mullion windows as shown in Figure 7.

Text: 4.2 West Elevation The extension on the north west corner of the building, beyond the gate, is likely to date from the early 20th century and appears to be a remodelling of the historic extension that stood in the same location. The materials used for the extension are dark engineering brick (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 10). Whilst only partially visible from the public realm it can been seen down the side-access route from the street.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation The photographs of the rear elevation (Figures 9 to Figure 23) show the three additional dormers inserted as part of the 1997 planning permission (application no. H/44360). Despite the use of timber with white infill these dormers do little to respond to the design of the rest of the building and appear oversized in relation to the existing building and the mullion windows below. The rear elevation was always far plainer than the front elevation, lacking the ornate latticework in the gable. The large slate- covered void comprising the lift-plant room visually detracts from the elevation.

Text: 4.3 Rear (North) Elevation From the north west, the blank façade of the extension in dark coursed brick is even more visible and overrides the material quality and detailing of the stonework on the rear elevation (Figure 10). The small outbuilding comprises a single-storey structure of common-brick bond, established c.1990s.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The building was designed in 1876 as the ‘St. John’s National School’ and was associated (and partly funded by) the adjacent St. John’s Church but remained as separate body, defined by its clearly enclosed boundaries.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR The ground floor was dedicated as the principal space for daily teaching and activities, with ancillary rooms likely used as cloakroom and additional classroom spaces. The central component of the building was divided into two parts, which reflects the usual arrangement of 19th century school buildings, which traditionally allowed for a separate ‘hall’ space for each sex. This arrangement is reflected in the separate playgrounds to the rear (Figure 25, below), which would have been accessed by independent exits to the rear of the building.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR It is thought that the central hall spaces to the ground floor historically comprised a double heighted space, which was later divided c.late 20th century when the building was converted into a medical centre; to create two separate floors. The west wing to the north-west of the building is however, believed to have always comprised of a ground and first floor. The original staircase and timber joists to this part of the building appear to date to the late-19th century and confirm this notion. The west wing of the building retains some evidence of historic fabric including original timber floors and chimney breasts but was extensively altered in the 1980s and again in the early 21st century to facilitate a new use (NHS doctors).

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Planning permission for the site’s redevelopment was successfully gained on 16 August 2021 (application ref: 101163/FUL/20) for a change of use and conversion of former medical centre into five dwellings. Following this, a soft strip exercise was undertaken to remove internal partitions and fixtures of no heritage significance. The soft strip allows for a better understanding of the building’s original plan form and historic components. The survey which has informed the present report (including images) was undertaken in November 2021 following completion of the soft strip.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Figure 26 and 52 below provide a visual indication of retained historic fabric (shaded red) and areas which are later alterations (in green) which were not removed as part of the soft strip exercise.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Whilst no original plans of the building are known to survive, historic mapping from 1876 provides some indication of the general internal layout of the ground floor to the former school building, which was formed of two principal rooms to the centre with smaller rooms to the west wing. The original brick walls (now overpainted) have been retained as part of the soft strip works and better convey the original, open plan form of the central hall spaces which were divided by a single wall. The soft strip has further revealed the original timber floorboards and original corbels which support the trusses above, these would have originally been experienced as a double heighted space; but the insertion of a new floor in the late-20th century / early 21st century has altered this.

Text: 5. DESCRIPTION OF ST JOHNS MEDICAL CENTRE - INTERIOR Access to the girl’s hall was originally provided from an entrance to the west and the boys entrance was situated to the east. The classrooms to the ground floor would have been designed to be well-lit, to ensure optimum daylight during teaching hours. The 1876 plan below (Figure 25) illustrates another
