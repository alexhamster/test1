Text: 1. Extent of development 1. Extent of development

Text: 1. Extent of development The residential family dwelling, a dormer bungalow built circa 1980, is located in the Old Market Conservation Area. See section 7 for details.

Text: 1. Extent of development The existing property has smooth red/buff multi facing brick at ground floor level with decorative stone cladding to the upper gable walls.

Text: 1. Extent of development The main roof has a brown concrete tile with a similar smaller gauge tile enveloping the rear dormer below a felted flat roof. White upvc sofiits and bargeboards have brown upvc rainwater goods attached.

Text: 1. Extent of development Windows are generally white upvc framed double glazed units.

Text: 1. Extent of development The attached garage has a felted flat roof, as does the conservatory to the rear.

Text: 1. Extent of development The detached property has driveway access from Groby Place, with access to an attached brick walled garage to the right hand side of the plot. Access onto the site is very restricted due to the width of Groby Place, and the raised planting bed to the front of the site. There is a brick wall enclosing the rear lawned garden area, with mature trees to the rear /side boundary.

Text: 1. Extent of development The applicants wish to improve the quality of the dwellings spatial planning and external fabric, mindful of the setting in a conservation area, to enhance the visual amenity along Groby Place and to the rear.

Text: 1. Extent of development The proposal is to extend to the rear of the premises at ground floor level following removal of the existing conservatory to create a living area in close contact with the garden area. The front door, currently on the side of a small porch, is to be replaced with a new door facing the road in an extended hall area below a new gabled roof.

Text: 1. Extent of development At first floor level a new gabled roof is proposed over the garage to create an additional bedroom. The existing rear dormer is to be re-clad in new contemporary materials and 2no gabled dormers added to the front roof to provide more natural light to rooms and create visual balance to the front elevation.

Text: 1. Extent of development The driveway is to be widened and the raised planting bed reduced in scale to facilitate easier vehicular access and improved access to the front door.

Text: 1. Extent of development The internal floor plan is to be re-modelled to create increased kitchen/living space at ground floor and an ensuited bedroom at first floor.

Text: 2. Layout 2. Layout

Text: 2. Layout The front door to the dwelling is on the side elevation of the porch facing Groby Place. A driveway in front of the attached garage leads to a path and gated access to the rear garden on the southern side elevation.

Text: 2. Layout The new ground floor extensions will create an improved access from the front door, a unified kitchen and living accommodation with immediate access to the rear garden. At first floor the extension over the garage will provide a new en-suited bedroom with glazed doors leading to a small balcony on the west elevation. Dormer windows and rooflights in the existing main roof will offer supplementary daylight to other bedrooms/bathrooms.

Text: 2. Layout Amenity space to the side and rear provides parking, cycle and refuse storage facilities. The private garden to the rear is to be replanted and raised beds re-profiled.

Text: 2. Layout The building lies on a relatively flat site. The ground floor level is elevated above external ground level by approximately 150mm

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal 3. Scale of the proposal

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The extensions are subservient to the existing building, which sits in a large garden plot, with no material loss of amenity space.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The proposed gabled dormers to the front are small and traditional in appearance. The roof of the first floor extension over the garage sits below the main ridgeline, and the front wall iss et back from the current front wall line.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal The materials used for the external envelope will improve the quality and appearance of the building.

Text: 3. Scale of the proposal There are no issues with regards to the extensions reducing/impacting on the visual amenity of adjacent dwellings.

Text: 4. Landscaping 4. Landscaping

Text: 4. Landscaping The rear private amenity space to the dwelling will have a paved surface outside the extension, leading to the existing lawned area. The widened driveway will have a paviored surface with sustainable drainage system.

Text: 4. Landscaping The existing brick boundary wall /hedging treatments will remain.

Text: 4. Landscaping 9

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment 5. Aesthetic treatment

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment The proposed extensions and render proposals seek to enhance the external appearance of the premises, using a simple unified palette of materials whilst retaining a traditional appearance of a pitched roof/gabled dwelling.

Text: 5. Aesthetic treatment The external materials proposed, - retained facing brickwork, grey roof tiles, dark grey composite board to dormers, render to gable walls, grey upvc and aluminium framed windows - are to complement the finishes proposed internally, with black steel framed glazed screens and timber doors to serve the new rooms. A single ply covered flat roof with lantern rooflight will provide a contemporary addition to the rear of the dwelling.

Text: 6. Access proposal 6. Access proposal

Text: 6. Access proposal The proposal seeks to improve the vehicular and pedestrian access to the premises from Groby Place, for the benefit of the applicant and other residents along Groby Place. At present there is no facility for visitors, who have to park on the narrow road, restricting its use for others, deliveries, refuse collections etc.

Text: 6. Access proposal The extension will have access from the existing Hallway, or alternatively external access will be available from the garden via a new stepped approach.

Text: 6. Access proposal 10

Text: 7. Context 7. Context

Text: 7. Context The premises lie in The Old Market Conservation Area, first designated in 1973 and extended numerous times, most recently in 2014. This Conservation Area is situated close to the centre of Altrincham.

Text: 7. Context 11

Text: 7. Context Conservation Area designation recognises the unique quality of an area as a whole. It is not just the contribution of individual buildings and monuments, but also that of features such as topography, layout of roads, pathways, street furniture, open spaces, and hard and soft landscaping which assist in defining the character and appearance of an area. Conservation Areas identify the familiar and cherished local scene that creates a sense of place, community, distinctiveness and environment. The extent to which a building positively shapes the character of a Conservation Area depends not just on their street elevations but also on their integrity as historic structures and the impact they have in three dimensions, perhaps in an interesting roofscape, or skyline. Back elevations can be important, as can side views from alleys and yards.

Text: 7. Context The special interest of the Old Market Place Conservation Area is defined in the Conservation Area Appraisal as ‘the medieval settlement core of Altrincham that retains evidence of the pre-1290 Charter layout in the current street scene. The Conservation Area has the character of an historic market town with a variety of inter-linked building types including civic, commercial and residential. The majority of buildings are 19th century or earlier and have high aesthetic value for architectural detailing and local distinctiveness. Small scale buildings utilising historic burgage plots front the street to create a strong building line and traditional materials give a sense of visual harmony. The Conservation Area is the meeting point of several major routes and the Market Place and later Market Street are a significant public gathering place, illustrating the continuous inhabitance of Altrincham from the medieval period to the present day. The continued use of the Historic Market Quarter of Altrincham as a vibrant civic and communal space makes it a significant heritage asset to the town’.

Text: 7. Context The applicants property is not listed. Nos 3-4 Groby Place, Edwardian period properties, have been subject of article 4 direction proposals. There are no listed buildings within the immediate vicinity of the site.

Text: 7. Context The dwelling is located to the north of Altrincham town centre with a full range of amenities and transport links available.

Text: 7. Context 12

Text: 7. Context 13

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment 8. Visual Impact Assessment

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The topography and screened rear garden areas, and limited outward looking fenestration will ensure no loss of amenity for neighbouring premises.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment Having regard to the site’s context the main heritage issues raised by this proposal would appear to be the potential impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the Old Market Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment This property is part of a frontage to Groby Place, which is located in the Conservation Area due to the presence of more prominent Edwardian premises rather than the application property.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment However, given its low building form, relatively late historical development and isolated position in respect of the more historic properties within the Conservation Area, the property makes only a modest contribution to its character and appearance.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The rear elevation is not a prominent element in the Conservation Area and the proposed extension will not be seen in the context of the wider Conservation Area. It is therefore considered that whilst the alterations to the rear elevation will result in some changes to the overall appearance of the property, they will not adversely impact on the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment The proposals to add gabled dormers to the front, remodel the front door and extend over the garage seek to improve the character and quality of the dwelling as part of the streetscene.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment It is therefore considered that the proposed extensions will not harm the prevailing character or appearance of the Conservation Area and the considered design of the proposed extensions will maintain the high quality of the built environment within this Conservation Area.

Text: 8. Visual Impact Assessment 14

Text: 9. Conclusion 9. Conclusion

Text: 9. Conclusion In conclusion the applicant is striving to modify and extend an existing building in a manner that fits comfortably within its environment and that complements the surrounding architecture. The applicants’ brief is to extend and improve the existing building, with good quality materials and detailing, that meets, as a minimum the current building legislation requirements for quality of construction and thermal performance, which represent a worthwhile investment, and can be implemented without imposition on the neighbouring buildings.

Text: 9. Conclusion In terms of footprint and massing the proposal is not a significant increase on the existing building footprint. The proposal responds well to its context, utilizing the existing aspect whilst seeking to maintain privacy for the occupants and the neighbouring residents.

Text: 9. Conclusion For the reasons set out above it is considered that the proposed development will not harm the character or appearance of the Old Market Conservation Area, or its overall significance. Consequently, this proposal complies with the requirements of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act and the local and national policy objectives that seek to protect the significance of heritage assets.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.1 Mulberry Tree Management were instructed by M Mulholland, to carry out an arboricultural survey of trees at her property in Groby Place, Altrincham.

Text: 1.0 Introduction This report details the arboricultural implications of developing the site, including:

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.2

Text: 1.0 Introduction • a survey of the trees on and near the development which may impact the proposal from ground level, noting their location, species and all relevant parameters, i.e. stem diameter, height, crown spread, condition etc;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • providing advice on the removal, retention and management of trees;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • assessment of the potential effects of the proposal on retained trees and vice versa;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • assessment of the requirement for tree protection for the duration of the works;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • mitigation for any loss;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • preparation of a tree schedule;

Text: 1.0 Introduction • and report on the above matters.

Text: 1.0 Introduction The survey was carried out on 15 July 2022 by means of inspection from ground level by an experienced and qualified arboriculturalist. The inspection can be restricted in cases where trees were Ivy clad or surrounded by vegetation.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.3

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.4 Under BS5837: 2012 Trees in Relation to Construction - Recommendations, the assessment of trees is made objectively. The tree categorisation method identifies the quality and value of the existing tree stock, allowing informed decisions to be made concerning development design layout.

Text: 1.0 Introduction The following documents have been made available by the client:

Text: 1.0 Introduction • Drawing- 22 239 PL100 plans and elevs as proposed arb issue 28.06.2022.dwg

Text: 1.0 Introduction The supplied drawing included some tree positions plotted. Any dimensions regarding tree positions and protective fencing must be checked on site.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.6

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.7 Weather conditions during the survey were dry and still.

Text: 1.0 Introduction 1.8 The survey was carried out noting the conditions of the trees at the time of inspection. As trees are part of the natural environment, conditions can naturally change; therefore the contents of this report are valid for one year only. After this period, re-inspection may be necessary.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.0 Survey Methodology

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.1 The trees were surveyed (prefixed T, or G for group) and recorded in the tree schedule in appendix one. Where groups are recorded, average height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trees in the group are reported. Where access to the base of any trees was limited, stem size was estimated.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.2 All the trees were assessed using: a grading A to C (retention) and U (removal); condition and age class as defined in appendix two.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.3 Where appropriate, canopy spread for each tree was recorded at four cardinal points in order to reproduce an accurate representation of the crown shape of the tree on the tree plan in appendix three.

Text: 2.0 Survey Methodology 2.4 The survey included all trees within the proposal area and trees near to the proposal.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.0 Development Proposals

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.1 Due to the proposed development and its associated infrastructure there are a number of locations where the proposals are in close proximity to the trees surveyed. The Site Layout Plan within appendix three identifies the trees in relation to the proposed development.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.2 In order to fully assess the impact of the proposals an Impact Table has been created detailing each tree, which shows the proximity of the associated works to the tree.

Text: 3.0 Development Proposals 3.3 This can then be assessed in accordance with BS 5837:2012 to determine whether the development will have a detrimental impact on the health of each tree. Once this has been determined remedial measures can be detailed to reduce the impact the proposals will have on the treescape.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.0 Discussion

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.1 The majority of the root system, of a tree, is in the surface 600mm of the soil, extending radially for distances frequently in excess of the trees height. Beyond the main structural roots (close to the base of the trunk), the root system rapidly sub-divides into smaller diameter roots: off this main system, a mass of fine roots develops.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.2 The shape of the main structural roots develops in response to the need for the tree to have physical stability. Beyond these major roots, root growth and development is influenced by the availability of water and nutrients. Unless conditions are uniform around the tree, which would be unusual, the extent of the root system will be very irregular and difficult to predict. It will not generally show the symmetry seen in the branch system.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.3 The parts of the root system, which are active in water and nutrient uptake, are very fine, typically less than 0.5mm diameter. They are short lived, developing in response to the needs of the tree, with the majority dying each winter. It is essential that conditions in the soil remain conducive to the healthy growth of these fine roots so that the water and nutrients necessary for healthy tree growth can be absorbed.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.4 All parts of the root system, but especially the fine roots, are vulnerable to damage. Once they are damaged, water and nutrient uptake will be restricted until new roots have regenerated. Vigorous young trees will be capable of rapid regeneration but over mature trees will respond slowly, if at all.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.5 In order to live and grow, roots need oxygen from the soil. Respiration by the roots and other soil organisms depletes this oxygen and increases carbon dioxide levels in the soil; a correct balance of these gases is normally maintained by diffusion between the soil and the atmosphere. Anything, which disturbs this balance, will affect the condition of the root system.

Text: 1.0 Discussion The factors that most commonly affect this diffusion adversely, and therefore damage roots, are the following: -

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.6

Text: 1.0 Discussion a) Compaction of the ground, which reduces the space between soil particles. This is particularly important on clay soils. A single passage by heavy equipment on clay soils or storage of heavy materials can cause significant damage.

Text: 1.0 Discussion b) Changing soil levels, even for a few weeks.

Text: 1.0 Discussion c) Covering the root area with impervious surfaces.

Text: 1.0 Discussion d) A rise in the level of the water table. Roots can tolerate submersion for short periods. But a permanent rise will deplete the soil of oxygen.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.7 Serious damage is often caused during preliminary site works by stripping the topsoil. For this reason, such works should be avoided until protective fencing has been erected.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.8 Excavations in the rooting area can severe roots. As the majority of roots are in the surface 600mm, even shallow excavations can cause damage.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.9 Excavations for foundations, landscaping or service trenches are usually sufficiently deep to sever most of the roots, and it should therefore be assumed that all parts of the root system beyond the excavation would no longer serve the tree.

Text: 1.0 Discussion 1.10 Excavation or soil stripping which severe or damage the roots may impair the stability of the tree and make it dangerous.

Text: 2.0 Method Statement 2.0 Method Statement

Text: 2.2 Protective Fencing All fencing used on the site should fully comply with BS 5837:2012 (Trees in Relation to Construction – Recommendations).

Text: 2.2 Protective Fencing 2.2.1 The fencing should be strong and suitable for local conditions. It should also take into account the degree of construction activity on the site.

Text: 2.2 Protective Fencing 2.2.2 The fencing should be at least 2.3m in height and should be erected with both a vertical and horizontal scaffolding framework capable of withstanding impact, with vertical tubes spaced at a maximum of 3 m. This should support either weldmesh panels which should be securely fixed with wire or scaffold clamps.

Text: 2.2 Protective Fencing 2.2.3 Notices should also be erected on the fencing stating ‘Protected Area - No operations within fenced area’.

Text: 2.2 Protective Fencing 2.2.4 The positioning of the protective fencing is also very important and should be erected in the proposed location identified in Appendix One. Once the fence has been erected it should never be crossed and particular care should be taken not to store any materials or soil within the protected area.

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3.1 Oil, bitumen, cement or other material likely to cause damage to the tree will not be stacked or discharged within 10m of the trees stem or within the protective area. Also materials in general will not be stacked or discharged within the exclusion zone.

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3.2 Concrete mixing and washing will not be carried out within 10m of any retained trees.

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3.3 Fires will not be lit beneath the foliage or in a position where the flames could extend to within 5m of the foliage, branches or trunk. If the fire is large then this may necessitate a distance of at least 20m.

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3.4 Trees that are to be retained will not be used as anchorage for equipment.

Text: 2.3 Additional Precautions Outside Fenced Areas 2.3.5 Notice boards, telephone cables, or other services will not be attached to any part of the retained tree.

Text: SUMMARY SUMMARY

Text: SUMMARY At 2 Groby Place in Altrincham planning permission is being sought to extend the house.

Text: SUMMARY As this could impact on features typically used by bats as roosting places, a diurnal inspection was undertaken on 22nd July 2022 to assess the building for signs of bat occupation.

Text: SUMMARY All the external and internal structures, especially those associated with the roof and walls of the building were examined.

Text: SUMMARY No signs of bat activity or occupation were found, and the suitability for roosting pipistrelles Pipistrellus sp or other bat species was considered negligible, as there were no suitable crevices or gaps.

Text: SUMMARY At the time of the survey, 2 Groby Place was not identified as a bat roost or hibernation site, and as such no further surveys or mitigation measures are required.

Text: SUMMARY *

Text: SUMMARY No bird nests were found either in or on 2 Groby Place.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION In mid-July 2022, Indigo Surveys was instructed to undertake a bat survey of 2 Groby Place Altrincham. On 22nd July 2022, a visit was made to the property to carry out a diurnal inspection of the building to check for signs of bat occupation.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The result of the survey is contained in this report.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION In England, Scotland and Wales, all bat species are fully protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) (as amended), through inclusion in Schedule 5. In England and Wales this Act has been amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW), which adds an extra offence, makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions, and increases penalties.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION All bats are also included in Schedule 2 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 1994, (or Northern Ireland 1995) (the Habitats Regulations), which defines ‘European protected species of animals’.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The above legislation can be summarised thus (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004):

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION Intentionally or deliberately kill, injure or capture (or take) bats

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION oooooo

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Deliberately disturb bats (whether in a roost or not)

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Recklessly disturb roosting bats or obstruct access to their roosts

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Damage or destroy roosts

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Possess or transport a bat or any part of a part of a bat, unless acquired legally

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Sell (or offer for sale) or exchange bats, or parts of bats

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The word ‘roost’ is not used in the legislation but is used here for simplicity. The actual wording is ‘any structure or place which any wild animal…uses for shelter or protection’ (WCA), or ‘breeding site or resting place’ (Habitats Regulations).

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION As bats generally have both a winter and a summer roost, the legislation is clear that all roosts are protected whether bats are in residence at the time or not.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY To fully assess bat occupation of a particular site, the Bat Conservation Trust (2016) recommends that information gathered from a desk study of known bat records, and a daytime site walkover, is used to inform the type and extent of future bat survey work, potentially including nocturnal surveys.

METHODOLOGY The diurnal walkover provides an opportunity to check for signs of occupancy, such as droppings, scratch marks, feeding remains, carcasses, or even animals in residence, whilst nocturnal surveys (if required) allow numbers and species of bats to be confirmed. The latter are also used to determine the presence or absence of bats, where signs of bat activity are indeterminate or absent, but suitability of roosting considered to be medium to high.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Roosting places vary depending on the species. Pipistrelles usually inhabit narrow cracks or cavities around the outside of buildings, but they will roost in similar niches inside larger barns. Typical sites include soffit spaces, gaps behind fascia boards and end rafters, crevices around the ends of projecting purlins, under warped or lifted roof and ridge tiles, or in gaps in stone and brickwork where mortar has dropped out.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Larger species such as Brown Long-eared Bats Plecotus auritus, Myotis bats (Natterer’s Myotis nattereri and Whiskered/Brandt’s M. mystacinus/M. brandtii), and Lesser Horseshoe Bats Rhinolophus hipposideros, like to roost in the roof voids of buildings, and can often be found hanging singly or in small groups from ridge boards or roof timbers, especially where they butt up against gable walls or chimney breasts. They especially favour older structures with timber frames. Here they squeeze into tight crevices making them difficult to observe.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Diurnal walkovers can be carried out at any time of the year, but nocturnal surveys should only be undertaken when bats are out of hibernation and in their summer roosts. The recommended period is from May to September inclusive, with May to August optimum and September sub- optimum. The season can be extended into October, although particularly cold weather will render this inadvisable. Indeed, the air temperature at the start of each survey must be at least 10°C or above.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Nocturnal Surveys will be a minimum of two weeks apart, and the number of surveys is dependent on the evidence found or the suitability of the site to bats.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Where bats are found, or there is evidence of bat occupation or activity, i.e., that bat use is confirmed, the number and timing of surveys will be decided by the ecologist and will be appropriate for the type of roost. In general, at least two nocturnal surveys will be carried out, both of which can be emergence surveys, or one emergence and one dawn re-entry.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Where there is no evidence of bat presence, and no suitability for roosting, no nocturnal surveys will be needed.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For a site with no evidence but low suitability, just one nocturnal emergence survey is required, this to be in the optimum period.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For medium suitability a minimum of two visits are needed, of which one must be in the optimum period, and one must be a dawn re-entry survey. With high suitability, three visits will be necessary, of which two must be in the optimum period. At least one of these must be a dawn re-entry survey, with the third visit either an emergence or a dawn re-entry.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For sites < 5 ha in size, and/or regularly shaped structures, at least two surveyors must be present, with more surveyors at larger sites and more complex buildings, e.g., those with multiple elevations and/or roof structures.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY On 22nd July a thorough inspection of 2 Gorby Place was made by Neil Musgrave (Natural England bat licence No. 2020-44602-CLS-CLS), including the exterior and interior walls, roof coverings, roof void, eaves, gables, window casements and door frames.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY 8x42 binoculars and a Fenix TK75 torches were used for the inaccessible/unreachable areas. On this occasion an endoscope was not used, as there were no crevices and cavities that could not be inspected with a torch or by use of binoculars from a ladder.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY The result of the survey is detailed in Section 3.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Bats tend to be seasonal visitors to properties and are not usually in occupation all year round. The females normally form maternity colonies during May or June and then leave for adjacent trees and/or woodland during July or August once the young bats are able to fly and become independent. Here they will spend the winter months in hibernation before returning to the house or barn the following spring.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Male bats generally live alone and have a number of favoured roosts. During the summer they visit each of these for a few days at a time, before moving to their chosen hibernation site in mid- late October. Different species have different habits, but this seasonal movement is common to all.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Bats choose their roosts carefully. During the summer they look for sites which are warmed by the sun, and as a result are most often found on the south and western side of buildings.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Pipistrelles, our smallest and commonest bats, prefer to roost in very confined spaces around the outside of buildings, typical places being behind hanging tiles, weather boarding, soffit, barge and eave boarding, between roof felt and roof tiles or in cavity walls.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As such they can be difficult to find, so the suitability for roosting was also assessed. This was considered negligible, as there were no suitable external crevices or cavities.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Another bat frequently encountered in buildings is the Brown Long-eared Bat. This is also a common species, but unlike pipistrelles, they prefer the dry, warm space of the loft or roof void, and can often be found hanging from roof timbers, especially rafters and the ridge board next to chimney breasts.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS No signs of Brown Long-eared Bat activity were found, nor evidence of other bat species which are commonly found inside buildings.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS At the time of the survey, 2 Groby Place was not identified as a bat roost, and as such no further surveys or mitigation measures are required.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS *

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS No bird nests were found either in or on 2 Groby Place.
