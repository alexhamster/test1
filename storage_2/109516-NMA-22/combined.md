Text: Decision Making Process Decision Making Process

Text: Decision Making Process There is no statutory definition of ‘non-material’ because it’s dependant on the context of the overall scheme (i.e. what is non-material in one case may be material in another). The only reference in the Planning Practice Guidance is to a need to have regard to the context, whilst the legislation refers to the effect of the change. The term non-material is also likely to cover many changes that could have previously been classed as de-minimus. Ultimately, therefore whether or not a change can be effected within Section 96A is a matter for the planning judgment of the Local Planning Authority acting reasonably.

Text: Decision Making Process In the case of such an application the Council have 28 days to make a decision. An application under Section 96A is not an application for planning permission therefore existing GDPO provisions relating to consultation and publicity do not apply. The Planning Authority has discretion in whether and how they choose to inform other interested parties.

Text: Decision Making Process In assessing the application the Planning Authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, and take into account any representations made by anyone notified provided they are received within 14 days of notification. A decision should be made solely as to whether the proposal is or is not a minor amendment.

Text: Decision Making Process As it is not an application for planning permission, Section 38(6) of the Planning Act 2004 does not apply. However, conflict with a reason for a previous decision may mean that the amendment is material.

Text: Decision Making Process A decision is not an issue of the original planning permission (which still stands); the two documents should be read together. However, the Planning Authority has the power (a) impose new conditions; and (b) to remove or alter existing conditions through this process.

Text: Planning Consideration Planning Consideration

Text: Planning Consideration We consider that the proposed amendment:

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not be contrary to the development plan or the NPPF.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not impact upon something that is regarded as one or more important material considerations, in the determination of the application.

Text: Planning Consideration Page 3 of 4

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not be a change to the Development that we consider would require consultation with consultees other than the Council.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not be considered to conflict with the provision of any other planning conditions. It is consistent with the details submitted through Reserved Matters submissions and condition discharge applications.

Text: Planning Consideration • The required amendment to amend the wording of condition 4 in relation to updated plan references, can be done through the Section 96a process.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not raise new planning issues/material considerations that have not previously been considered.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not be considered to be a significant change to the proposals that is anything other than a non-material change.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not alter the nature or description of the development.

Text: Planning Consideration • Would not result in any increase in pedestrian or vehicular traffic.

Text: Planning Consideration On this basis, we consider that this proposed change could be dealt with under a Section 96a submission as a non-material amendment to the original proposals.

Text: Planning Consideration We trust that the submitted information is sufficient to be validated and await written confirmation of the target date for a decision. Should you require any further information or clarification then please do not hesitate to contact us on the attached details.
