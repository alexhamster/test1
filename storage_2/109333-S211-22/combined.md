Text: Ascerta NOTE: The Category Grade applied to trees surveyed is consistent with the recommendations within Table 1 of BS5837: 2012, however this does not necessarily correlate with the visual importance of a tree within the wider landscape, nor does it dictate which trees should be retained at the cost of quality development. Where trees are to be lost to accommodate a development, recommendations will be made such as to provide suitable mitigation and compensation, and to integrate the development into the wider landscape.
