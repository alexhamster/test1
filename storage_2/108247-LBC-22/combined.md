Text: Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY

Text: Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY Garry Miller is a heritage consultant, architectural historian and published author who has spent more than 35 years studying and working with buildings of town and countryside, in particular those of North West England. His career as a consultant began in the mid-1980s with the Preston-based Nigel Morgan Historic Building Consultancy, of which he became a partner in 1992 upon its rebranding as Datestone. In 1997 he was commissioned by the Heritage Trust for the North West, a buildings preservation trust based at Barrowford, Lancashire, to produce an in-depth regional study of vernacular houses in southwest Lancashire: the result, Historic Houses in Lancashire: The Douglas Valley, 1300-1770 was published in 2002. The book was described as ‘scholarship as its best’ by Country Life (June 2003), and ‘well analysed and presented’ in Transactions of the Ancient Monuments Society (Vol 48, 2004); and was widely cited in the 2006 Buildings of England volume on Liverpool and Southwest Lancashire. Extensive research on the houses of Georgian and Regency Liverpool has also been undertaken, with a view to future publication. Following the success of his Douglas Valley book, Garry Miller established his own consultancy, producing analytical and interpretive reports on historic buildings, in particular the heritage assessments required to support planning applications affecting the historic environment. His area of operation encompasses the North West, Midlands, North Wales and parts of Cumbria and North and West Yorkshire. Several local authorities have cited his assessments as examples of best practice, and reports on more than 150 buildings or sites are produced annually.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report supports proposed works at The Old Vicarage, Bowdon, in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester. As the name suggests the property was built as the vicarage to St Mary’s parish church in 1863-1864, but has been subsequently subdivided to form two private residence, The Old Vicarage and Denehill. Together they form a single Grade II listing, and stand within Devisdale Conservation Area.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Proposals have been submitted to Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council for an extension, alterations and landscaping at The Old Vicarage. The heritage considerations arising are the proposal’s impact upon the significance (i.e. heritage interest and value) of the listed building and its setting along with the significance of the conservation area. The scope and purpose of this report is to identify this significance and to evaluate how it will be affected.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Grade II designation of The Old Vicarage and Denehill denotes a building of national importance for its special architectural and historic interest. Its significance essentially derives from this intrinsic special interest and can be summarised as follows:

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its architectural and historic interest as an example of an early 1860s vicarage in Victorian Gothic style

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • The elements and features which date from this period and thereby define its character and appearance

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its historical interest as an example of the work of William Hayward Brakspear, a notable Manchester architect

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its historical and communal association with St Mary’s parish church as a place of worship within the village

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its setting on the edge of the historic village core, amid the 19th century villas on Park Road

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For similar reasons, the listed building also makes a positive contribution to the conservation area, but only in terms of what can be publicly seen. The interior, and the private rear and gardens, do not contribute as they cannot be seen. An adjoining modern garage, conspicuous and of no interest, makes a negative contribution to both the setting of the listed building and to the character and appearance of the conservation area.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As will be examined in this report, it is concluded that the works will sustain the significance of the listed building and will also enhance its external appearance, and that of the site generally. Its contribution to the conservation area will be similarly enhanced. The proposal is therefore in accordance with national planning guidance and the local development plan, and therefore merits approval without delay.

Text: 2: THE SITE 2: THE SITE

Text: 2: THE SITE The proposal building is located in the village of Bowdon, in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester. As its name suggests, The Old Vicarage was formerly the vicarage of the village’s parish church of St Mary. It stands on Park Road around 250 metres southwest of the church where the ancient village core meets the surrounding 19th century villa suburbia built for affluent commuting Manchester businessmen. A large detached property standing within spacious gardens, the house was subdivided into two private dwellings – The Old Vicarage to the west and Denehill to the east – when its original role ceased in the mid-20th century.

Text: 3: THE PROPOSAL/BACKGROUND TO THIS REPORT Paragraph 194 of Chapter 16 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (as revised, July 2021) states local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of the heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The scope and purpose of this report is therefore to describe the significance of the listed building and conservation area and to assess how this will be affected by the proposal. It is considered the level of detail presented is, in accordance with paragraph 194, proportionate to the importance of the heritage assets, and no more than is necessary to understand the proposal’s impact. This report is to be read in conjunction with other documentation submitted in support of the application.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING 4.1 Overview

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING Large Victorian Gothic former vicarage of dark brick with minimal polychrome brickwork details, now subdivided to form two dwellings.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING 4.2 Historical summary

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING The Old Vicarage dates from1863-1864, and designed by Manchester architect William Hayward Brakspear (1818-1898), who was responsible for rebuilding the parish church of St Mary in 1858-1860. The cost was just over £3,000. The following account of the vicarage appeared in The British Architect of February 6, 1874:

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING Bowdon, the beautiful retreat for the wealthy classes of Manchester, has been several times brought under the notice of our subscribers, and again furnishes us with a subject for illustration. The new vicarage house and stables were erected by the late Archdeacon Pollock, in the years 1863-64, from Queen Anne's Bounty Fund in part, and in part also from a profit derived from an exchange of land with Lord Stamford. It stands on an acre and a quarter of land, within sight of the church, and on the highroad from Bowdon to Dunham. Mr Breakspear, of Manchester, who had then recently carried out most successfully the rebuilding, extension, and restoration of the fine old Parish Church, was professionally engaged to carry out the work. The whole external elevations are faced with common brick—white-headers—having Stourton stone dressings. The roofs are covered with Welsh slates. The chimney terminals were designed by the architect to avoid smoke and down draughts. At a future time we hope to give the view from the highroad, with a plan, and possibly some further remarks ; in the meantime it may be both valuable and interesting to furnish the total cost somewhat in detail. The amount of the Builder's contract for works generally was £2,319 10s 5d. Reserved Account: cost of grates, ranges, chimneypieces, marble bath, and slab to lavatory, £117 12s; heating apparatus, £10; boundary walls and gates, £112 12s; ornamental tiling and cement, cellar floors, £36. 12. 6d.; gas mains and polished-brass furniture, £88. 12s 6d ; ironmongery and lightning conductor, £55 7s 2d; ornamental glass, £3 12s. 6d; asphalt work in yard, £5 17s; laying out of grounds, planting with trees and shrubs, carriage way, drainage, £121; Architect's commission, £142;

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING charge for plans for Bounty Office, £10. Total, £3,022 16s. 1d.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING The property as built stood in a large wooded plot, with a small outbuilding (probably the stables referred to in the description above) to the west. It remained in use as the vicarage until the 1950s when replaced by Windy Ridge on Church Brow, which was built as a private house in the 1930s. The conversion to the present two dwellings occurred thereafter, along with the subdivision of the plot to build a new dwelling, The Orchard, to the west.

Text: 4.2 List description 4.2 List description

Text: 4.2 List description The National Heritage List for England description of The Old Vicarage and Denehill, compiled at the time of designation in 1985, incorrectly gives its date as 1873. It reads:

Text: 4.2 List description Vicarage, now two houses. Said to be 1873. Header bond brick, stone dressings, slate roof. 4 x 3 bays with central staircase and 2 storeys plus attic. Stone quoins, first floor string, coped gables. Bay 1 has 2 pointed lights on each floor with cusped heads and polychromatic brick voussoirs and a roped gable. Bays 2 and 3 form a tower-like entrance feature with weathered buttresses, a 2-light tracery-headed window, 3 cusped lights on the first floor which is canted in plan, and a swept mansard roof which is supported on timber brackets and includes a half-hipped attic dormer window. Bay 4 is similar to 1 except that a 3- light ground floor and 2-light first floor window have flattened arch heads and the mansard gable accommodates a double attic light. The sides and rear are treated similarly the rear having 2 canted bay windows with similar Gothic

Text: 4.2 List description lights.

Text: 4.3 Further analysis 4.3 Further analysis

Text: 4.3 Further analysis The principal interest of the building is in its front and rear elevations, which, with their sober brickwork, minimal polychrome detailing and traceried windows convey the core character and interest of the listed building. The side elevation is plain by comparison, the explanation being that this was originally the ‘working’ end of the building, facing an enclosed yard in which the stables stood. The side door which currently forms the entrance to the application property appears to date from the 1950s subdivision, and the hall within has had a WC inserted. Adjoining the entrance a single-storey projection housing what was probably a scullery originally and is now a kitchen, again a result of the subdivision. Facing it is a double garage, a probably mid-20th century structure of no interest which is visible from the streetscene.

Text: 5.1 Overview 5.1 Overview

Text: 5.1 Overview The Devisdale Conservation Area was first designated in 1974. It covers a large and area straddling the western fringe of Altrincham and its boundary with neighbouring Bowdon. Primarily residential, it also includes the landmark Church of St Margaret, a lawn tennis club and several nursing homes. The application building stands in the southern portion of the conservation area (Map 4, below).

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest 5.2 Character and special interest

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest The special qualities of the conservation area are described in the character area appraisal adopted by Trafford MBC in 2016. This summarises its special interest as follows:

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The Devisdale, from which the conservation area takes its name, is a historic area of unenclosed flat land on the summit of Bowdon Hill

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • In the second half of the 19th century the area was developed by the Earl of Stamford to create a high-class, low-density residential suburb for prosperous commuting Manchester businessmen

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • This is typified by houses, often on a grand scale, set in large gardens with sweeping drives and coach houses

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The properties display a great variety of style, with some designed by renowned architects

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The residential area is characterised by the boundary treatments and mature trees along the roads and in gardens

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • Streets are lined with low garden walls of large stone blocks, with hedges of various species above and trees along the boundary.

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • While many of the roads belong to the planned Victorian development, others pre-date this period, such as Bowdon Road, the historic route between Altrincham and Bowdon Parish Church

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The gradients create views which embody the character of the area, including glimpses of St Margaret’s tower and along individual tree-lined roads

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The area was characterised in the 19th century by a lively and vigorous social, sporting and intellectual life

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • Several road and house names refer to “Racefield” suggesting horse racing took place. From 1896, The Devisdale was the site of the annual Altrincham Show, one of the largest agricultural shows in England

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • A much-valued open space, The Devisdale was gifted by the Earl of Stamford to the people of Altrincham in the 1930s

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The conservation area provides numerous and varied habitats for wildlife

Text: 6: summary of significance 6: summary of significance

Text: 6: summary of significance 6.1 Rationale

Text: 6: summary of significance Paragraph 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework states local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of a heritage asset, including its setting, and take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal in order to avoid or minimize conflict between the asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal. Significance is defined in the NPPF Glossary as:

Text: 6: summary of significance The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset's physical presence, but also from its setting.

Text: 6: summary of significance 6.2 The listed building

Text: 6: summary of significance The Grade II designation of The Old Vicarage and Denehill denotes a building of national importance for its special architectural and historic interest. Its significance essentially derives from this intrinsic special interest and can be summarised as follows:

Text: 6.3 The conservation area 6.3 The conservation area

Text: 6.3 The conservation area The significance of The Devisdale Conservation Area derives from its character and appearance as a prestigious suburb established by the Earl of Stamford in the mid-19th century for affluent Manchester commuters. It is characterised by detached and semi detached villas, often on a grand scale and designed by leading architects, set in large gardens along tree- lined roads. The area is primarily residential but also contains the historic open space of The Devisdale and the landmark church of St Margaret. The conservation area is divided into five character areas, of which the application property stands within area C, which is characterised by a mixture of historic properties, including large villas and modern developments. While the significance of the conservation area extends primarily to the borough-wide context, it contains several buildings listed as being of national importance.

Text: 7: planning policy context 7: planning policy context

Text: 7: planning policy context 7.1 Statutory duty

Text: 7: planning policy context Section 66 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires local planning authorities to give special regard to the desirability of preserving a listed building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest. Section 72 (1) requires local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character of a conservation area.

Text: 7: planning policy context 7.2 Relevant polices

Text: 7: planning policy context Chapter 16 of the Revised National Planning Policy Framework provides the guidance on how the statutory duty is to be put into practice. Paragraph 197 states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: 7: planning policy context • The desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation

Text: 7: planning policy context • The positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and

Text: 7: planning policy context • The desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness

Text: 7: planning policy context Regarding designated heritage assets, paragraph 199 states that ‘great weight’ should be given to their conservation and the more important the asset, the greater that weight should be; that significance can be lost through development within its setting.

Text: 7: planning policy context The local planning context is established by policies of Trafford Council’s Core Strategy, adopted January 25, 2012, along with saved policies of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan, adopted June 2006. Relevant to this application is policy R1 of the Core Strategy (Historic Environment), which states:

Text: 7: planning policy context R1.1 All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.

Text: 7: planning policy context R1.2 Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8: Impact of the proposal

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8.1 The extension

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal The proposed extension is to provide a porch, kitchen and utility room and is to be attached to the west elevation of the listed building. As noted above, this elevation is more functional and hence there are relatively few features that will be affected or obscured. The principal alteration is widening of the existing entrance, which does not appear original and dates probably from the 1950s subdivision. The adjoining window is to be retained. In terms of scale, the extension is subservient to the listed building, which will remain predominant in public streetscene views. Its appearance and detailing replicate the Victorian Gothic of the original building and thus avoids any sense of architectural discordance. The impact of the extension is accordingly considered a neutral one, in respect of both the listed building itself and its contribution to the conservation area.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8.2 Alterations/other works

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal a. Existing kitchen. New internal steps will be created to the basement, and new partitions inserted to form a WC. The room has been altered to accommodate its present use and no visible historic features will be lost. The works will therefore have a neutral impact.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal b. Entrance hall. The existing non-original WC and partitions, inserted following the 1950s subdivision of the property, will be removed, reinstating the former proportions of the hall. The effect of these works will be positive.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal c. Lounge. A new doorway will be created to access the proposed kitchen. This has a minor adverse impact in terms of fabric loss, but this is not considered sufficient to damage the significance of the building in overall terms.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal d. Creation of bathroom on attic floor. This involves subdivision of the existing bedrooms, blocking of an existing doorway and relocation of the two existing doors and frames. These rooms are plain and functional (being servants’ rooms originally) and no historic features will be lost. The works will have a neutral effect.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal e. External refurbishment. Brickwork is to be cleaned using conservation-approved methods and traditional materials. Gutters are to be similarly cleaned and chimneys and pots repaired as necessary. These works will enhance the appearance of the building, and its visual role within the conservation area, and are therefore positive.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal f. Internal features. All original features are to be retained and protected during the work. Plasterwork will be repaired where necessary on a like-for-like basis. All new doors, architraves, skirting, cornices etc are to match the original. These works will have a positive effect.

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 8.3 Garage/landscaping

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping The existing detractive modern garage is to be removed and a landscaping scheme introduced in the gardens to the front side and rear, as fully detailed elsewhere in the submitted documentation. These works will therefore enhance the setting of the building and, in respect of those to the front and side, how it is seen publicly from within the conservation area.

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 11. Visualisation showing how the landscaping works will appear in public view

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 8.4 Conclusion

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping For the reasons given above, the works will sustain the significance of the listed building and will also enhance its external appearance, and that of the site generally. Its contribution to the conservation area will be similarly enhanced. The proposal is therefore in accordance with national guidance and the local development plan, and therefore merits approval without delay.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON Barnes Wlaker have collaborated with Jonathan Riddle Architects to prepare the Landscape Design.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The garden setting has remained unchanged for many years and has been waiting for a makeover to support the appearance and functioning of the house.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The landscape design will rationalise the spaces around the house and create a greatly enhanced setting for the refurbished property.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The Rhododendrons have extended massively towards the south and the property and cover almost half the front garden. These will be coppiced back to rationalised stumps to allow for a new cycle of growth. The new loose gravel drive will provide generous parking for 2-3 cars and leave an open view towards the front courtyard. One of the two original gate piers still exists with the top of the second lying on the ground. The second pier will be rebuilt across the double opening to better bookend the shared drive approach, rows of setts will link these two features.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON A new Holly hedge will be planted on top of the boundary wall to better define and articulate the frontage. The view down the drive will focus on the small arrival courtyard.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON This set piece space addresses the front door and serves as a transition between front and rear gardens. Presently this space is compromised by the blank rendered wall of the neighbouring property and the unnecessarily low ground levels. The levels in the area dip down to then rise again towards the rear patio. The proposal is to raise levels so that only 2 steps are needed into the house.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON A metal trellis will provide a high-level frame for climbing roses with a lower section providing security and an enclosure for the family pet dog. The small pair of gates will act as a welcoming feature into the private courtyard.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The arrival courtyard leads out to the private rear garden areas via a mainly solid timber gate, storage areas for bins, bikes and general paraphernalia will be created behind a brick wall structure. This simple structure will appear as a garden wall from the front and neighbouring property. A section enclosed by doors will provide secure storage where as an open section will offer a neat place for bins and logs and have a depth of view from the utility window. The terrace will be surfaced in natural stone paving leading onto a simple grass bank. Beyond this area the garden will remain unchanged.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The new garden setting will compliment the house and its proposed extensions and make a positive contribution to the area.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT National Planning Policy Framework

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The National Planning Policy Framework says, in Paragraph 8, that there are 3 overarching objectives to achieving sustainable development. These are an economic role (contributing to the economy), a social role (supporting communities) and an environmental role (protecting and enhancing the natural and built environment).

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 11 requires a presumption in favour of sustainable development

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Section 12 of the NPPF is headed “Achieving well designed places” Paragraph 124 says that: “The creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.”; and that “Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Section 16 of the NPPF “Conserving and enhancing the historic environment” covers heritage matters.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 189 says

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 190 says:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 192 goes on to say

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “In determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 196 sets out that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimal use.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 197 says that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 200 says that “Local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas and World Heritage Sites and within the setting of heritage assets to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of the asset should be treated favourably.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT SPD4 sets out the council's detailed design guidance for householder development. It says that “The Council will seek to ensure that extensions and alterations are of a high standard of design, are compatible with and not harmful to local character, do not adversely affect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, take account of existing landscaping and trees and have adequate off-street parking provision and access arrangements.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Section 2 deals with general design guidance for all forms of development.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The SPD advises that when considering an application for a domestic extension or alteration, the Council will take these general principles into account:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Planning Practice Guidance: DCLG published the Planning Practice Guidance on 6 March 2014. It which replaced a number of practice guidance documents. Its section on design was revised on 1st October 2019.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The National Design Guide published in October 2019 sets out the characteristics of well- designed places and demonstrates what good design means in practice.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT THE CASE FOR THE APPLICANT Design and Access Considerations

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Design Principles

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The key elements identified in Policy L7 of the Core Strategy have all been important factors in the evolution of the proposed development. The proposed extensions and alterations are of a high quality of design; have good functionality; have been designed to minimise impact on the amenity of occupiers of existing properties and also on the future users of the development itself; regard has also been given to security and accessibility in the detailed design of the property. The proposed extension and alterations have been designed to be energy efficient.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The design advice in the National Design Guide has guided the approach the design of the extensions and alterations, which has been influenced positively by:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the history and heritage of the site, its surroundings and the wider area, including cultural influences;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the significance and setting of heritage assets and any other specific features that merit conserving and enhancing;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the local vernacular, including historical building typologies such as the terrace, town house, mews, villa or mansion block, the treatment of façades, characteristic materials and details.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Appraisal of context

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The importance of the site’s location within the Devisdale Conservation Area was a key part of the design process. The context includes the surrounding properties on Park Road, including those which are identified as making a positive contribution to the conservation area. This assessment is covered in more detail in the separate heritage statement.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Access

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The premises as extended and altered will meet building regulations in terms of accessibility into and within the property.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Heritage Considerations

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The property is also grade II listed and a separate Heritage Statement accompanies these planning and listed building consent applications.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Figure 2: Townscape analysis (extract from CAA) Key: Cyan = positive contributor; Magenta = Listed building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed extensions and alterations have been specifically designed to a high standard to enhance the property. The proposed extensions have been designed to sit comfortably with the original architecture and local context, by incorporating aspects of the existing house, such as using matching materials and design features.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed materials are of a high quality and are appropriate to the context and setting of the building, and would reflect and echo those used on the existing traditional building and other buildings in the area.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In our view, the character of the property will be maintained, as shown on the design drawings and the proposed extension and alterations enhances the property within the conservation area to which it lies. The extension will not be visible from the street frontage due to the high level of boundary screening to the frontage of the site and the fact that the existing property is well set back from the frontage as shown on the design drawings. Therefore, the impact upon the conservation area and listed building setting is minimal. Taking into account the scale, design and form of the proposed extension and alterations, as well as the mature landscaped

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT 26a Victoria Road ● Hale ● Cheshire ● WA15 9AD ● t: 0161 928 4433 ● f: 0161 928 4433 e:sales@arcdesignservices.net ● www.arcdesignservices.net

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT screening to the boundaries, these works will not appear over-dominant, obtrusive or out of place in the context of the existing building. Taking into account the siting of the extension and alterations, it is our view that there will be no impact on the setting of any of the adjacent buildings.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed alterations to the existing property also make direct reference to the originally approved scheme in 1950 when the original Vicarage was converted into two separate semi- detached dwellings, whereby various alterations and extensions were intended to be carried out to the property, some of which were carried out. An extract of these original changes can be seen below.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In the context of the scale of the existing house, the extension to the side is small in scale. It is clearly subordinate in scale and single storey. It will be set away from the west boundary. Alterations to the elevations will be well designed and stylistically appropriate. Taking into account this set-back, the design of the proposed alteration to the side elevation, and the scale and height of the extension; it is our view that there will be no impact on the setting of any of the adjacent buildings.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is worth giving consideration as to how to apply the council’s detailed guidelines relating to house extensions and the standing of the property in relation to the adopted conservation area guidelines.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is important to note that SPD4 sets out guidelines, not definitive policy. All properties are different and it is important to look at each individual case on its own merits, looking at the relevant specific locational factors and circumstances. This is acknowledged in paragraph 1.1.3

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT 26a Victoria Road ● Hale ● Cheshire ● WA15 9AD ● t: 0161 928 4433 ● f: 0161 928 4433 e:sales@arcdesignservices.net ● www.arcdesignservices.net

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT of SPD4, which says that “whilst these guidelines seek to provide some clarity on the main issues, there will be situations which are not covered by these guidelines as circumstances vary. All applications are considered individually and on their individual merits”.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In the context of the consideration of this application it is perhaps most useful to look at whether the development fits within the broad criteria set out in the SPD’s general principles. We would argue that it does, in that:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • It has been carefully designed to harmonise with the character of the dwelling, and neighbouring houses, by reflecting the design, detailing, and proportions of the existing dwelling.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The materials match those on the original house.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The extension is relatively small in scale and is single storey.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The extension would not lead to the loss of any significant trees and the large front and rear garden would be effectively retained.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • There would be no adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties and the surrounding area.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • There would be no adverse impact on the adequacy of the parking provision

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The proposal represents sustainable design, with a high level of energy efficiency

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development will retain all that is significant that the building contributes to the conservation area and the listed building, as well as the set-back from the street and the overall form of a semi-detached house in modest grounds.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed extension culminates from a well thought out design by an experienced designer, resulting in a high quality development appropriate to its context and which will enhance the building.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT No key views and vistas will be affected.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The development abides by the parameters set out in section 3.3 of the Management Plan, which sets out what is considered inappropriate development within The Devisdale Conservation Area, in that it:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve a significant loss of front garden space in favour of off-road parking

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT respects a sympathetic balance of hard surface area to garden

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve the removal and/or alterations to historic boundary walls, gate posts and/or gate openings

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • whilst it involves a small side extension, the proposed design is well thought out and it will have no adverse impact on the conservation area or listed building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the extension will not significantly reduce the intervening space between the existing building and plot boundary

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve the subdivision of an existing plot into multiple plots

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve demolition of important features harmful to the conservation area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • involves alterations which are stylistically appropriate and utilise an appropriate palette of materials to complement the existing building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve basement development work which will significantly alter the proportions of a building’s exterior

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development conforms to the policies of the Management Plan in that it:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • uses appropriate materials and techniques, and uses an appropriate palette of materials

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not have an adverse impact on existing boundary treatments

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • has no adverse impact on existing green spaces, the public realm or key views within the Conservation Area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • would not adversely impact on the landscaped quality of the area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT 26a Victoria Road ● Hale ● Cheshire ● WA15 9AD ● t: 0161 928 4433 ● f: 0161 928 4433 e:sales@arcdesignservices.net ● www.arcdesignservices.net

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • retains the character of the built environment and has no adverse impact on archaeology.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Even if the council came to the view that there would be harm to the conservation area (and there is no reason why it should), this could not be considered as substantial. There would be a public benefit in that it would allow improvements, which are important in keeping buildings in use, as their improvement makes them more attractive for future custodians.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is our view that overall the proposed development preserves the character of the Devisdale Conservation Area as such the proposal is in accordance with national and local policies and guidelines, as well as the advice contained in the National Design Guide.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Impact on residential amenity

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The extension has been designed to ensure that adequate privacy distances are retained to adjacent properties. The extension to the side will project into the area behind the main frontage of the building. Overall, it is our view that new windows on the rear elevation will not raise concerns regarding potential overlooking and interlooking.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Other matters

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT There are no highways issues arising from this low key development, which will have no adverse impact on the local highway network. Vehicular access and car parking arrangements will remain as existing.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development will not require any trees to be removed as part of the development therefore it will have no impact upon the landscape character of the area.

Text: CONCLUSION CONCLUSION

Text: CONCLUSION The proposed extension has been carefully designed to respect the original building and the local context. The extensions would preserve the character and appearance of The Devisdale Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal passes the statutory test in Section 72 of the Planning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990. The extension and alterations will have little or no adverse impact on nearby buildings.

Text: CONCLUSION It is considered that the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF and Core Strategy Policies R1.1, R1.2, R1.3, R1.6, R1.7, R1.9 and L7. Planning permission should be granted.
