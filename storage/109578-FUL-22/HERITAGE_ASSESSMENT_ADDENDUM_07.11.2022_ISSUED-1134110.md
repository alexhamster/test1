Text: 1. Introduction 1.1

Text: 1. Introduction This Heritage Addendum has been prepared by Paul Butler Associates on behalf of McGoff Construction Ltd in support of a revised planning application relating to the former Downs Hotel, 46 – 50 Railway Street, Altrincham, WA14 2RE. The site is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. 46 – 50 Railway Street which historically occupied the site has been identified as a non-designated heritage asset.

Text: 1.2 The description of development is: 1.2 The description of development is:

Text: 1.2 The description of development is: ‘Demolition of the front façade wall and other remaining elements of the former Nicks Bar building, including the entrance archway and the erection of a two storey building comprising a ground floor mixed use commercial and business floor space (Use Class E), with a single residential apartment (Use Class C3) above, the erection of a replacement entrance archway and other associated works’

Text: 1.2 The description of development is: A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment prepared by Dickenson Waugh Conservation (‘the DWHS’) was issued in February 2021 and submitted in support of a previous application at the site which included the retention of the building’s façade. This Heritage Statement assessed the significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street, other affected heritage assets and the impact of the scheme on the significance of those assets.

Text: 1.2 The description of development is: 1.4

Text: 1.2 The description of development is: The scheme now proposed broadly reflects that which has previously been approved. In addition to some minor design changes, the key change is in relation to the building’s historic façade which is now proposed to be deconstructed, and a replacement building of the same design constructed in its place. Historic fabric will be salvaged and re-used where possible. This Addendum report therefore considers the conservation impact of the

Text: The Site 46 – 50 Railway Street is understood to have originally been constructed in c.1835 and was historically known as The Downs Hotel. Figures 1 – 4 illustrate the site and its immediate surroundings (Site visited on 30 October 2022). The majority of the building has been demolished, with a part single, part two storey façade being the single remaining element. The single storey element to the south is 2 bays wide, with a cart / vehicle accessway to the left and window with canopy to the right.

Text: The BO Report 2.3

Text: The BO Report A ‘Structural Review of Front & Gable Elevation Stability Report’ was prepared by Blackett- Ord (‘the BO Report’) and issued in May 2022. This set out the results of a visual inspection, a review of the then-current engineering proposals (which had formed part of the previous planning consent), and set out recommendations. Based on a structural assessment of the façade, the BO Report noted the following:

Text: Associates Paul Butler integrity.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ The remaining part of the gable wall is currently compromised by the changes in the wall profile being supported on the remains of timbers and fractured stone fire

Text: Associates Paul Butler hearths.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ A safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪

Text: Associates Paul Butler That the façade should be dismantled by hand. Should the integrity of the wall be found to be more robust at lower level, then dismantling could cease.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ The recording of the dimensions, details and materials of the façade together with salvaging suitable materials for future re-use would minimise potential loss and maximise potential re-use of historic fabric.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 2.4

Text: Associates Paul Butler It is understood that progressing this strategy as soon as possible is necessary, for safety reasons, as well as in light of temperatures dropping this winter (2022) which could result in further structural instability, and loss of historic fabric.

Text: The Surrounding Area The Surrounding Area

Text: The Surrounding Area 2.5

Text: The Surrounding Area The site is bounded to the north by the 2 storey 42 - 44 Railway Street (restaurant use at ground floor, apartments at first floor level) and the 3 storey 2 – 4 The Downs to the south (former RBS Bank at ground floor, apartments above). Both buildings are of historic merit, but neither are nationally Listed (See Figures 3 and 4).

Text: The Surrounding Area 2.6

Text: The Surrounding Area The surrounding area is largely characterised by mixed use developments and features a broad range of building types/ages/styles including mainly smaller two / three storey mixed use buildings and less common larger 4 plus storey buildings. Building materials range from red brick, bronze brick and painted brick with a mixture of sloped and flat roofs. The site is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area, and part of a wider development site which extends into the neighbouring Downs Conservation Area. The site is situated within Altrincham Town Centre and is therefore in a highly accessible and sustainable location.

Text: 3. The Proposed Scheme 3.1

Text: 3. The Proposed Scheme The proposed scheme comprises the deconstruction of the remaining part of the building, and the erection of a two storey building comprising a ground floor commercial unit and first floor residential apartment. The proposed building has been designed to reflect the building which historically occupied the site, and will include the erection of a replacement entrance archway. During the deconstruction works, historic fabric will be salvaged and re- utilised within the scheme where possible. Planning permission has previously been granted for a broadly similar scheme.

Text: Background and Reasons for Application Background and Reasons for Application

Text: Background and Reasons for Application Planning Permission Ref 95548/FUL/18 was secured on 7 June 2019 for a scheme which included the demolition of side and rear extensions to 46 – 50 Railway Street, the conversion of the ground floor of the building for commercial use, and the conversion of the upper floor to an apartment (See Table 3.1). This was as part of a scheme which also included the construction of new build residential development to the rear.

Text: Associates Paul Butler A further planning permission was secured on 27 July 2021 (Ref: 103419/FUL/21) which related solely to 46 – 50 Railway Street. This was for a development broadly similar to that approved by planning permission 95548/FUL/18 but which included for additional demolition of the building with just the façade to be retained.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 3.4

Text: Associates Paul Butler Since approval of 103419/FUL/21, the building has been mostly demolished with just the street-facing façade remaining. Structural advice has confirmed that the façade is not structurally sound and must be deconstructed.

Text: The Proposals The Proposals

Text: The Proposals 3.5

Text: The Proposals As set out in the BO Report, the retention of the historic façade and its incorporation into the proposed scheme is not possible, and its structural condition requires that it is deconstructed as soon as possible (See Para 2.3 above). The BO Report and McGoff Report include recommendations as to how the works can be carried out safely and sensitively, whilst maximising the historic fabric which can be reincorporated into the proposed building. Where this is not possible, materials will be sourced which are reflective of surrounding historic buildings and the character of the Conservation Area.

Text: Consultation with Trafford Council Consultation with Trafford Council

Text: Consultation with Trafford Council 3.6

Text: Consultation with Trafford Council Extensive discussions have taken place between the applicant, its design team, and Trafford Council (TMBC) since Council officers alerted the applicant regarding the façade’s potential structural instability in April 2022. Whilst TMBC are now satisfied that the façade should be deconstructed, they have determined that such works would not be within the scope of the extant planning permission 103419/FUL/21 and requested that a further planning application be submitted.

Text: Consultation with Trafford Council 3.7

Text: Consultation with Trafford Council This Addendum is therefore submitted in support of a Planning Application which seeks consent for the deconstruction of the façade, and the construction of a replacement building, which seeks to replicate the design of the building which historically occupied the site.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 5.2

Text: Paul Associates Butler Paragraph 1.5 of the DWHS confirmed that the ‘significance’ of heritage assets was assessed in accordance with the policy and guidance set out at Paragraph 4.1 above. An Addendum to the DWHS was also prepared following a meeting with TMBC officers on 22 April 2021 which considered some minor changes to the proposed scheme as well as the necessity for the removal of rear walls. This did not however affect the conclusions of the DWHS.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 5.3

Text: Paul Associates Butler The affected heritage assets and their key elements of significance as set out within the DWHS, and which are relevant to the current planning proposal (which includes the deconstructing and reconstruction of the building’s façade) are summarised below.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area 5.4

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area Section 3.3 reviews the summary of the Conservation Area’s special interest as set out within the Conservation Area Appraisal. The following is of note:

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area ▪ The focus of the Conservation Area is along the gentle curve of Railway Street and Stamford New Road leading to Altrincham Interchange.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area ▪ The designation combines early 19th century development along Railway Street with a cohesive group of good quality late 19th and early 20th century buildings along Stamford New Road and adjoining streets, testifying to the prosperity and confidence of the town.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area ▪ Building elevations fronting the street display a variety of good quality architectural styles, detailing and expression, particularly to upper floors, which contribute a high level of aesthetic and historic value to the Conservation Area.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area ▪ There are a number of consistent design details for example the use of splayed corners and plaques with names, initials and dates displayed.

Text: Stamford New Road Conservation Area ▪ Generally, buildings sited along Railway Street are 2 storeys in height and domestic in scale increasing to 3 storeys and a larger scale along Stamford New Road and some adjoining streets.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ Buildings tend to be traditional in form with pitched roofs and front the street.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ The scale, massing, and form of buildings results in a strong building line and sense of enclosure, this contributes to the visual interest and rhythm of the streetscene.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ The consistent use of traditional building materials and local details repeated throughout the Conservation Area provides a sense of visual harmony. The majority of buildings are constructed from red brick laid in traditional bonds with pitched blue slate roofs and painted timber windows.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 5.5

Text: Associates Paul Butler A description of 46 – 50 Railway Street is set out within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal (CAA). This describes the building prior to its near total demolition. Whilst some of what is described is lost (i.e. ‘pitched roof cladded with blue slate’), the description does note that ‘The windows on the ground floor are tall in shape and have stone sills and headers, the first floor windows are vertical sliding sash windows which are painted in white. The entrance of the building has a solid wooded panelled door that has two decorative corbels beside it’. The then-current and former uses of the building (hotel and subsequently public house) are noted, with a concluding comment that ‘The building reflects the traditional former uses in the area. It illustrates the development of the settlement in which it

Text: Associates Paul Butler stands’. (DWHS Section 3.1)

Text: 46 – 50 Railway Street 46 – 50 Railway Street

Text: 46 – 50 Railway Street 5.6

Text: 46 – 50 Railway Street In relation to the building itself, Section 4 of the DWHS includes an assessment of the building’s heritage value (as at February 2021) and focuses on those elements which would be affected by the proposals at that time.

Text: 46 – 50 Railway Street 5.7

Text: 46 – 50 Railway Street In terms of ‘historic interest’, the building being illustrative of a significant period in local history representing a period where the town was experiencing enormous growth and positive change is noted (Para 4.2.2). The building’s origin and historic purpose is noted as being associated with the railway and the extension to the Bowdon Terminus (Para 4.2.3). The building is identified as a local landmark, holding some communal value and noting that this is perhaps as ‘part of a group than individually, but local residents will draw some pride and sense of place from historic buildings such as this’ (Para 4.2.4).

Text: Associates Paul Butler The ‘archaeological interest’ of the building is set out. It is noted that the building retains little if anything of value internally. The internal spaces are of course lost following demolition of the majority of the building. Also lost is the then-remaining chimney stack to the southern gable, and it is noted that externally ‘the building has received extensive modern intervention, broadly cosmetic with the significant features still evident’ (Para 4.3.3). These significant features along with the relationship between the building (as ‘tangible evidence’) and the history / evolution of the area are therefore the key elements of archaeological interest.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 5.8

Text: Associates Paul Butler 5.9

Text: Associates Paul Butler The ‘architectural and artistic interest’ is identified as comprising the building’s retention of its architectural form and its historic identity. The Heritage Statement notes that ‘The painted brick somewhat detaches it visually from its contemporaries but it still presents as a significant structure along the street-scene’ (Para 4.4.2).

Text: Summary of Significance Summary of Significance

Text: Summary of Significance 5.10

Text: Summary of Significance Section 5 of the DWHS provides a Statement of Significance. It confirms that the building is not regarded in any way to be of exceptional or high significance. Medium significance is attached to the building’s ‘associative, illustrative and communal values’ in terms of it acting as a contributory reminder of the historic development of the town; its architectural interest (albeit diluted by modern intervention and limited to its façade) and its impact when viewed from within the public realm. The now-demolished structure behind the facade is identified as being of neutral value, with intrusive elements comprising harmful ‘low quality’ alterations to the building’s architectural appearance, which has also caused harm to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area (Para 5.2).

Text: Summary of Significance 5.11

Text: Summary of Significance In terms of historic significance, the Statement concludes that this ‘considered to be LOW to MEDIUM and is limited to what remains of the original building which both serves as a reminder of its, and the local area’s history and contributes to the character of the Conservation Area’. The ‘frontage of the building and significant elements which can be viewed from the highway’ are identified to be of greatest significance, with the façade of the building maintaining ‘both its presence and its aesthetic contribution’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 5.12 Whilst there have been some minor policy changes since the DWHS was completed and some additional guidance published, none of this would impact upon the way the report was completed or its findings and the statement of significance is therefore regarded as being up to date. Notwithstanding this, it is noted that the ‘low to medium’ level of significance has diminished further due to the loss of some further elements which contributed to that significance. The historic significance of the remaining part of the building (its façade) is considered to be ‘low’.

Text: 6. Impact on Significance 6. Impact on Significance

Text: 6. Impact on Significance 6.1 The DWHS included an ‘Impact Assessment’ (Section 7) which assessed the impact of the proposed scheme on the basis of Historic England guidance.

Text: 6. Impact on Significance 6.2

Text: 6. Impact on Significance It is understood that the development proposed as part of the application resubmission will result in a development which broadly reflects that which has been previously approved under the planning consents within Table 3.1, but with the existing façade to be deconstructed (rather than retained). The purpose of this Section within this Heritage Addendum is to consider whether or not the impact of the now-proposed scheme (which includes the deconstructing of the building façade – the single remaining intact feature of the building) varies from that which has previously been assessed and approved by TMBC, and if it does, whether such impact is acceptable in conservation terms.

Text: 6. Impact on Significance 6.3

Text: 6. Impact on Significance Section 7 within the DWHS noted that the replacement of PVC windows with timber windows will reinstate historic consistency in terms of material use and quality, whilst the proposals would also retain the presence of the building and its illustrative, associative and communal values. Whilst the proposal is now to deconstruct the remaining part of the building and for it to be reconstructed using a mixture of sympathetic new and salvaged materials from existing, the positive conservation aspects of the scheme mentioned within the Statement are retained.

Text: 6. Impact on Significance 6.4

Text: 6. Impact on Significance The DWHS also considers the impact of the proposed scheme on two viewpoints from within the Conservation Area. In relation to the impact upon these views, the Statement notes:

Text: Paul Associates Butler ‘The retention of the façade of the building and its southern gable, together with the neighbouring low-level frontage and cart entrance, albeit non-original, is clearly important to preserving associative, illustrative and communal values and also the historic character of the area. The demolition and reconstruction work to the rear of the building will have no perceivable impact. The proposed changes to the frontage of the building will bring about positive change, primarily to the aesthetics within the views, but also the authenticity and integrity of the quality of the buildings within the views.’

Text: Paul Associates Butler It is noted that the demolition of the rear of the building (which has since taken place) will have no perceivable impact, and the positive change resulting from the approved proposals will broadly remain subject to the implementation of the scheme now proposed. It is noted that the ‘changes to the front of the building are wholly positive’ and also that once complete, ground floor public house use could be reinstated at some future point thereby reinstating an historic use. In terms of mitigation, the Statement notes:

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.5

Text: Paul Associates Butler ‘The demolition of the structure to the rear of the façade will of course result in the loss of a small amount of historic and original building fabric, although nothing of particular importance in terms of features or craftsmanship. The building holds no greater value than its contribution to the Conservation Area and the preservation of its presence and architectural integrity overwhelmingly mitigate against any perceived loss.’

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.6

Text: Paul Associates Butler The scheme as now proposed will of course result in the loss of the building’s façade which is the key element of its contribution towards the Conservation Area. However, the reconstruction of this in complementary materials, along with the construction of a building behind which is of the historic proportions and materiality of the former building will improve the site’s contribution to the streetscape and ultimately the character of the Conservation Area.

Text: Paul Associates Butler a balanced judgement is therefore required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the non-designated heritage asset; whilst the harm to the Conservation Area (a designated heritage asset) must be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.8

Text: Paul Associates Butler 46 – 50 Railway Street which previously occupied the site was identified as a non-designated heritage asset by virtue of it being identified as a positive contributor to the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. The Conservation Area is a designated heritage asset and contains multiple other designated and non-designated heritage assets. This Heritage Addendum has therefore reviewed the relevant parts of the DWHS and undertaken a supplementary assessment in support of the now proposed scheme. The proposed scheme broadly seeks to achieve approval for a similar scheme to that which was previously approved at the site under Planning Permission 103419/FUL/21, but includes for the

Text: Impact of the Scheme on the Heritage Significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street 6.10 Whilst the significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street has arguably already been lost due to its near-total demolition, it is clear from CAA, the DWHS, and from this Heritage Addendum that the part which remains standing was the building’s most significant element. The application proposals will result in the total loss of this non-designated heritage asset. NPPF Paragraph 203 therefore requires a balanced judgement to be had having regard to the scale of any

Text: Impact of Scheme on the Heritage Significance of The Conservation Area 6.11

Text: Impact of Scheme on the Heritage Significance of The Conservation Area The Stamford New Road Conservation Area’s special interest is summarised within Section 5. Prior to the demolition of much of the building, 46 – 50 Railway Street had been identified as a ‘positive contributor’ to the Conservation Area. Further to the demolition of the rear part of the building, the site now detracts from the special interest of the Conservation Area. The building’s façade (which was previously accepted as the primary element of this contribution) is now all that remains.

Text: Paul Associates Butler The application proposes the deconstructing of the building’s façade which once complete will have a negative impact upon the character of the Conservation Area, simply due to it removing a structure which currently encloses a short section of Railway Street, as it has been since the construction of the building in the early to mid 19th Century. The application proposals include the construction of a building on the site, including the re-creation of the building’s façade (including brick arches, soldier courses, and stone bands), and the building’s roof (including the re-use of salvaged blue slates and chimney pots). The reconstructed building façade will see the re-use of salvaged materials, the use of a red brick reflective of surrounding red brick heritage assets within the Conservation Area, the reinstatement of architectural features, and the use of timber windows and doors which reflect the character of the Conservation Area in the way that the existing PVC windows and doors do not.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.12

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.13 Whilst the historic interest of 46 – 50 Railway Street was ultimately limited, the most significant aspect of this was identified as being its association with the rapid expansion of Altrincham in the 19th Century, particularly in relation to the arrival of the railway. The reconstruction of the building in the same architectural style and utilising complementary / salvaged materials ensures that this link can continue to be understood. Furthermore, the use of a brick which reflects the building’s original and historic appearance arguably enhances the site’s contribution to the character of the Conservation Area.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.14

Text: Paul Associates Butler The proposed scheme is therefore regarded as having a significant positive impact upon the character of the Conservation Area, and a positive impact upon the settings of designated and non-designated heritage assets therein. Whilst the original building will be totally lost, its visual contribution to the Conservation Area will be greater than at any point in recent decades. The re-use of the site which will include commercial use at ground floor

Text: Paul Associates Butler level will further enhance this contribution.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.15 Whilst no harm to the Conservation Area has therefore been identified, in accordance with NPPF Paragraph 202 any perceived harm (which it is assumed would be regarded as less than substantial) resulting from the scheme should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. These are extensive and include:

Text: Paul Associates Butler ▪ The wider regeneration benefits associated with The Downs Quarter development and the benefit this will bring to the town centre.

Text: Paul Associates Butler ▪ Contribution towards the housing land supply, at a time the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year housing land supply position.

Text: Paul Associates Butler ▪ Ensuring the delivery of residential development and commercial floorspace in a sustainable and accessible location.

Text: Paul Associates Butler 6.16

Text: Paul Associates Butler Reference to the BO Report confirms that the remaining part of 46 – 50 Railway Street was found not to be structurally sound, and the deconstructing of the façade is therefore necessary as a matter of urgency. The application proposals therefore constitute the best and only option in terms of maximising the heritage benefits of a development proposal at the site.

Text: Mitigation Mitigation

Text: Mitigation 6.17

Text: Mitigation Prior to its substantial demolition, 46 – 50 Railway Street contributed positively to the character of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. Its own significance as a non- designated heritage asset had been limited due to the extent of intervention and change, and this significance has been further diminished following the demolition. The building’s greatest significance had been its contribution to the character of the Conservation Area, and the application proposals present an opportunity not only to restore that contribution, but also to enhance it. This enhancement is partly achieved through the conservation mitigation which forms part of the scheme, and which includes:

Text: Mitigation ▪

Text: Mitigation The design of the façade and roof of the replacement building which reflects the historic design of 46 – 50 Railway Street in terms of design features, and new and salvaged materials.

Text: Mitigation ▪ The incorporation of a brick that reflects the elevational treatment of the building and is more in-keeping with the character of the Conservation Area, resulting in the visual harmony between the site and Conservation Area which the CAA identifies as a key element of its character.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ▪ The proposed building’s continued part commercial use at ground floor level, and the provision of accommodation at first floor level which broadly reflects the historic site uses.

Text: Associates Paul Butler 6.18

Text: Associates Paul Butler Subject to the incorporation of the above mitigation, the application proposals are regarded as being acceptable in policy terms, due to the harm resulting from the total loss of a non-designated heritage asset which is of low significance, being outweighed by the significant positive impact upon the Stamford New Road Conservation Area (a designated heritage asset). It is also acknowledged that the harm associated with this proposal is greater than the previous application 103419/FUL/21. However, the harm is outweighed by the low significance of the non-designated heritage asset, and the public benefits that the proposals will produce. As is concluded within the BO Report, the application proposals are regarded as the single development option available and subject to successful

Text: Associates Paul Butler implementation, will maximise the heritage benefit to the site.

Text: Appendix A – Policy Review Appendix A – Policy Review

Text: Appendix A – Policy Review The heritage planning policy of relevance to the proposed scheme, and which provides the context for its assessment, is set out within national and local planning policy guidance. These policies have been considered in the preparation of this Addendum.

Text: Appendix A – Policy Review been considered in the preparation of this Addendum.

Text: Appendix A – Policy Review Section 38(6) of the Town and Country Planning Act 2004 states that applications for development should be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. In the case of Trafford Council, the adopted Development Plan consists of the Core Strategy (adopted 2012) and the saved policies of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan. Due consideration in the determination of the application will also need to be afforded to national policies in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which represents a significant material consideration.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Detailed guidance about the legislation is given in National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which was first published on 27th March 2012 and last updated on 20 July 2021 and sets out the Government's planning policies regarding the conservation of the historic environment. The original NPPF and its subsequent updates are a key part of reforms to make the planning system less complex and more accessible; to protect the environment; and to promote sustainable growth. It replaces all previous planning policy guidance and is a material consideration in planning decisions.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) The NPPF places great emphasis on the role of decision makers to promote sustainable development. Paragraph 8 advises that sustainable development has three dimensions: ‘economic, social and environmental’.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) In relation to determining planning applications, the NPPF sets out a presumption in favour of sustainable development. For decision taking this means approving development that accords with an up-to-date development plan without delay (Paragraph 11).

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Section 16 of the NPPF deals with conserving and enhancing the historic environment. Paragraph 194 advises that ‘In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by

Text: Associates Paul Butler their setting’. This statement demonstrates that the information and significance requirements of national policy have been complied with.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 195 of the NPPF advises that ‘Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 196 states that ‘Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect of, or damage to, a heritage asset, the deteriorated state of the heritage asset should not be taken into account in any decision’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 197 of the NPPF advises that ‘In determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of: a) the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; b) the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and c) the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 199 of the NPPF advises that ‘When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 200 advises that ‘Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification. Substantial harm to or loss of a) grade II listed buildings, or grade II registered parks or gardens, should be exceptional; b) assets of the highest significance, notably scheduled monuments, protected wreck sites, registered battlefields, grade I and II* listed buildings, grade I and II* registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage Sites, should be wholly exceptional’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 201 advises that ’Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following apply:

Text: Associates Paul Butler the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and

Text: Associates Paul Butler no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through

Text: Associates Paul Butler appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and

Text: Associates Paul Butler conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and

Text: Associates Paul Butler the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 202 advises that ‘Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Paragraph 203 advises that ‘The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset ’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler Annex 2 of the NPPF provides a glossary of key terms which are relevant to this application. ‘Significance’ is defined as: ‘The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting ’.

Text: Associates Paul Butler ‘Setting of a heritage asset’ is defined within Annex 2 as ‘The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral’.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) The National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) is a web-based resource which was launched in March 2014 and coincided with the cancelling of the majority of Government Circulars. It provides guidance on many aspects of planning including plan-making and decision taking.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) It states ‘Heritage assets may be affected by direct physical change or by change in their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent and importance of the significance of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, is very important to understanding the potential impact and acceptability of development proposals’.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) In relation to the setting of a heritage asset, the NPPG states ‘A thorough assessment of the impact on setting needs to take into account, and be proportionate to, the significance of the heritage asset under consideration and the degree to which proposed changes enhance or detract from that significance and the ability to appreciate it.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) Setting is the surroundings in which an asset is experienced, and may therefore be more extensive than its curtilage. All heritage assets have a setting, irrespective of the form in which they survive and whether they are designated or not.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) The extent and importance of setting is often expressed by reference to visual considerations. Although views of or from an asset will play an important part, the way in which we experience an asset in its setting is also influenced by other environmental factors such as noise, dust and vibration from other land uses in the vicinity, and by our understanding of the historic relationship between places. For example, buildings that are in close proximity but are not visible from each other may have a historic or aesthetic connection that amplifies the experience of the significance of each

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) The contribution that setting makes to the significance of the heritage asset does not depend on there being public rights or an ability to access or experience that setting. This will vary over time and according to circumstance.

Text: National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) When assessing any application for development which may affect the setting of a heritage asset, local planning authorities may need to consider the implications of cumulative change. They may also need to consider the fact that developments which materially detract from the asset’s

Text: Paul Associates Butler significance may also damage its economic viability now, or in the future, thereby threatening its ongoing conservation’ (Paragraph 013 Reference ID: 18a-013-20140306).

Text: Paul Associates Butler With regard to assessing substantial harm, National Planning Practice Guidance advises: ‘Whether a proposal causes substantial harm will be a judgment for the decision taker, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the policy in the National Planning Policy Framework. In general terms, substantial harm is a high test, so it may not arise in many cases. For example, in determining whether works to a listed building constitute substantial harm, an important consideration would be whether the adverse impact seriously affects a key element of its special architectural or historic interest. It is the degree of harm to the asset’s significance rather than the scale of the development that is to be assessed. The harm may arise from works to the asset or from development within its setting.’ (Paragraph: 017 Reference ID: 18a-017-20140306).
