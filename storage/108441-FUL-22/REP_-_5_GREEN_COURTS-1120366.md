Text: Comment Details Comment:Having digested the proposed ground floor plans I believe the ground floor serving hatch (on the cross street side) will provide congestion to the already congested cross street side of the building. That footpath is impassable during busy periods such as after school and weekends and adding queues of people along that stretch will further push pedestrians into the road area where, with the increase in delivery drivers (Deliveries/deliveroo/justeat) I have already witnessed countless incidents and near misses.

Text: Comment Details I have videos of that piece of footpath during such times and this clearly shows numbers of children spilling into the road as it is. This is without the addition of a queue of customers in their way.
