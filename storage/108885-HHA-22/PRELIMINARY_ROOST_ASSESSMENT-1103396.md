Text: 1.4. Reason for survey The development proposals are for a full height side extension of the property including changes to the roof, and changes to the internal layout.

Text: 1.5. Site context 1.5. Site context

Text: 1.5. Site context The house is located on Harrington Road, Bowdon, WA14 4QY, GR SJ 75831 88107, approximately 1.5km west of Altrincham Town Centre. The house is in a residential area surrounded by large suburban houses and mature gardens with trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site includes an occupied detached house, with an attached garage, gardens to the front and rear, and areas of hard landscaping.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 50m of the house includes; houses, gardens, mature trees, small areas of open green-space, and busy well-lit roads.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 500m includes, housing and busy roads, linked back gardens, areas of open green-space, hedgerows, watercourses, and mature trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context Areas of open green space locally, and linked back gardens, potentially provide foraging opportunities for bats. However, the area in general is fragmented by busy well-lit roads, noise, trafﬁc, and other human activity.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site and surrounding area provide low quality foraging, commuting, and roosting opportunities for bats, with higher quality habitat to the southwest around Dunham Massey.

Text: 2.1. Survey timings The survey was completed on 27th July 2022. Weather conditions during the survey were bright, warm, and dry, with a temperature of 20°C.

Text: 2.2. Desk study 2.2. Desk study

Text: 2.2. Desk study No desk study of the site was undertaken, prior to the preliminary roost assessment, and no other ecological surveys have been carried out in relation to the proposals.

Text: 2.2. Desk study The development has a small footprint, and impacts beyond the site boundary are unlikely. A site-speciﬁc investigation was considered more suitable.

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment 2.3. Habitat assessment

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment The habitat on site and in the surrounding area was assessed using Ordinance Survey mapping, and aerial photography. Habitat features on site, and those in the surrounding area were assessed for their suitability for use by bats during the site visit.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection 2.4. Building inspection

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the exterior of the building was made to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate any evidence of bats such as live or dead specimens, bat droppings, urine splashes, fur-oil staining and or squeaking noises. Bat specimens and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence; the other types are not always the result of bat activity. Sometimes bats leave no visible sign of their presence on the outside of a building (even when they do wet weather can wash evidence away.)

Text: 2.4. Building inspection The search included (where present) the ground beneath potential access points, windowsills, window panes, walls, behind peeling paintwork and lifted rendering, hanging tiles, weatherboarding, eaves, sofﬁt boxes, fascia’s, lead ﬂashing, gaps under felt, under tiles / slates and in existing bats boxes. Gaps in brickwork and stonework were searched (where present). All evidence of use by bats, or features with the potential to be used by bats was recorded and photographed.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the inside of the building was undertaken to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate evidence of bats. Bat specimens (live or dead) and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence. Other evidence can include urine splashes, fur-oil staining, feeding remains, squeaking noises, bat ﬂy (Nycteribiid) pupal cases (Hutson 1984) or odour.

Text: 3. Results 3.1. External inspection

Text: 3. Results 3.1a – The front of the house.

Text: 3. Results No4 Harrington Road, Bowdon, is a modern detached house, which is currently occupied. It has a pitched roof, covered with slate roof tiles, and ceramic ridge tiles. A ground ﬂoor extension to the rear has a ﬂat roof covered with a modern rooﬁng membrane.

Text: 3. Results Roof pitches face north, south, east, and west; gables face north & south. Lead ﬂashing is ﬁtted at the base of chimneys, around dormers, and where roof tiles abut brickwork. UPVC fascia boards are ﬁtted at the eaves.

Text: 3. Results Walls are brick with an insulating cavity, discreet steel lintels are ﬁtted, sills are UPVC; window and door frames are UPVC, all glass is intact.

Text: 3. Results The building was extended and refurbished in 2017, it was built to a high standard, is well maintained, and in good condition. Ridge tiles are ﬁxed tightly, there are no damaged or missing ridge tiles. There are no damaged, slipped, or missing roof tiles. Roof tiles are tightly ﬁtted, with no gaps between tiles. UPVC fascia boards are ﬁtted to the end of rafters and purlins with a wide gap between boards and brickwork. Gaps between boards and brickwork at the eaves are ﬁlled with sealant. Walls are in good condition, with no missing mortar or cracks.

Text: 3. Results There are no features externally which are likely be used by roosting bats, and no indications of use by bats were present during the inspection.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2. Internal inspection

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2a – The roof void.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The house has a single roof void, which is not used for storage, and is accessed infrequently for essential maintenance.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The roof has a trussed timber structure, lined with a modern breathable membrane, and insulated with mineral wool between the ceiling joists. The roof lining is in good condition with no tears, or gaps.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The wall cavity has been ﬁlled with insulation and was inspected at the wall plate using an endoscope. There are no gaps at the wall-plate; and there are no gaps which give direct access to the roof void from the outside. Boxed sofﬁts open into the roof void and were inspected from above.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The house has no cellar, and there are no other enclosed spaces which are suitable to be used by roosting bats.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.3. Indications of use

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection No indications of use by bats were present during the survey, either internally, or externally.

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability 3.4. Level of suitability

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability The house has negligible suitability for use by roosting bats. This is as the building is well maintained, in good condition, and as no suitable roosting opportunities were noted during the building inspection.

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability Preliminary Roost Assessment | 4 Harrington Road - Bowdon | 28th July 2022

Text: 4. Evaluation 4. Evaluation

Text: 4. Evaluation The building is set in an area which, in general, provides low quality habitat, for foraging, commuting and roosting bats, although bats are likely to be present locally.

Text: 4. Evaluation Areas of open green space, and linked back gardens locally provide limited foraging opportunities for bats, in an area which is fragmented by light and noise disturbance.

Text: 4. Evaluation Houses immediately adjacent to good quality habitat are more likely to be used by roosting bats than those further away. However, the house is well-sealed, and has no features which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The area in general is fragmented by well-lit roads, trafﬁc, noise, and other human activity. Fragmentation is likely to reduce the number of species present locally, and the number of individual bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The house was recently extended and refurbished, is well maintained, and in good condition. There are no features externally, which are suitable, or likely to be used by roosting bats; the roof void has no gaps which could give direct access to roosting bats, and no evidence of use was found during the inspection.

Text: 4. Evaluation The lack of any indications of use inside the roof void, such as bat droppings or feeding remains, reduces the likelihood of a signiﬁcant roost being present. If bats were present inside the roof void, even in lower numbers, some evidence of use would be likely to persist.

Text: 4. Evaluation Roof and ridge tiles are in good condition, ridge tiles are sealed with cement. There are no gaps between rooﬁng materials which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The walls are brick with an insulating cavity. The wall cavity has been ﬁlled with insulation. Walls are in good condition, with no cracks, or missing mortar which could be used by crevice dwelling bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Window and door frames are ﬁxed into the brickwork, gaps are ﬁlled with sealant, and offer no suitable roosting opportunities.

Text: 4. Evaluation UPVC fascia boards at the eaves are ﬁxed to the ends of rafters & purlins with a wide gap between boards & brickwork, and do not offer suitable roosting opportunities for bats. Wall cavities open into the roof void, and were inspected from above.

Text: 4. Evaluation The small gaps between brickwork, roof timbers, and rooﬁng materials, in the roof void were inspected in detail using an endoscope. No droppings were found, and no suitable gaps were present which could give access, or shelter to roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Taking into account the habitat surrounding the site, and the features present, the building is unlikely to be used by roosting bats and has negligible suitability for use.

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 4.1. Legal and planning context

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context All species of bats in the UK and their roosts are legally protected by UK and European legislation. The UK the legal protection is summarised as follows:

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context You will be committing a criminal offence if you:

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 1. Deliberately* capture, injure or kill a bat

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 2. Intentionally or recklessly disturb a bat in its roost or deliberately disturb a group of bats

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context Preliminary Roost Assessment | 4 Harrington Road - Bowdon | 28th July 2022

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 8

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 3. Damage or destroy a bat roosting place (even if bats are not occupying the roost at the time)

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 4. Possess or advertise/sell/exchange a bat (dead or alive) or any part of a bat

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 5. Intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a bat roost even if bats are not present at the time

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context *In a court, ‘deliberately’ will probably be interpreted as someone who, although not intending to capture/injure or kill a bat, performed the relevant action, being sufﬁciently informed and aware of the consequence his/her action would most likely have.

Text: Impact assessment Impact assessment

Text: Impact assessment The development proposals are for a full height side extension of the property including changes to the roof, and changes to the internal layout.

Text: Impact assessment The building has no features which are suitable, or likely to be used by roosting bats and has negligible suitability for use.

Text: Impact assessment The proposed work is unlikely to impact on bats or bat roosts; and, once completed is unlikely to provide any increase in levels of disturbance for bats locally.
