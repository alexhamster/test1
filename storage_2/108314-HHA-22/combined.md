Text: HERITAGE AND DESIGN & ACCESS STATEMENT JUNE 2022

Text: HERITAGE AND DESIGN & ACCESS STATEMENT MAISON IOM limited 83 Ducie Street | Manchester | M1 2JQ 0161 883 2824

Text: INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION

Text: INTRODUCTION The following combined Heritage and Design & Access statement has been produced in connection with our householder planning application at 74 The Downs, Altrincham, Cheshire. The proposed works include a side return extension, extending nearly to the back line of the existing rear outrigger on at ground floor, with underpinning & conversion of the existing cellar to create additional basement accommodation.

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE The site is situated within the Downs conservation area (CA). It is positioned on the south edge of the original part, designated in 1973. The designation has since been extended to the south & west.

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE There are a number of grade II listed buildings in the immediate vicinity - 5 within approximately 200m. The closest two have been indicated on the site location plan (extract opposite):

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE 1. A boundary stone marking the boundary of the Anglo-Saxon borough of Altrincham;

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE 2. Downs Place, a row of cottages circa 1840,

Text: HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE Any planning application is required to demonstrate that the proposals will not lead to ‘unacceptable harm’ to a heritage asset or its setting.

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA The CA is characterised by the relatively undisturbed high quality architecture of properties dating predominantly from the early 19th century through to the early twentieth century. The Conservation Area Appraisal also notes the contribution ‘historic boundary treatments notably sandstone walls, gateposts and hedging’ make to defining the character of the street scene.

Text: BOUNDARY STONE BOUNDARY STONE

Text: BOUNDARY STONE Carved boundary stone set into a wall, circa 1840, which marks the Anglo Saxon boundary of the borough of Altrincham. The stone’s significance relates to the heritage of the Massey family & the influence they have historically had in the area.

Text: DOWNS PLACE DOWNS PLACE

Text: DOWNS PLACE A row of cottages which are a particularly good example of architectural brick detailing with large windows and crafted roof detailing.

Text: CONTEXT CONTEXT

Text: IMMEDIATE SITE CONTEXT IMMEDIATE SITE CONTEXT

Text: IMMEDIATE SITE CONTEXT It is considered unlikely there will be archeological interest of any significance in relation to the conservation area given that the buildings in the immediate vicinity date from C19 or later. The closest two listed buildings, are between 40-80m away & date from the C19. It is therefore also unlikely there will be archeological interest of any significance on the application site in relation to these.

Text: IMMEDIATE SITE CONTEXT The property itself is part of a terrace which does make a positive contribution to the character of the conservation area. The front of the property is constructed of Accrington smooth red clay bricks & is pleasantly proportioned with a gable front, bay window & small dormer window with rooflight to the top floor. The rear of the property is more modest in appearance, composed of banded wirecut bricks with fewer projecting features & simple brick fan arches above the windows.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT The proposed development is for a ground floor extension to the rear side return along with the remodelling & underpinning of existing basement spaces. The extension will have a flat roof with stone coping to a parapet wall with fixed crital glazing and black painted metal rainwater goods.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT This increase in floor area will extend the ground floor of the property into the side return to create a larger open plan ground floor family space whilst making use of the central part of the ground floor plan for ground floor amenities, namely cloaks storage and ground floor WC.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT At lower ground floor underpinning to fully utilize all the cellar chambers including those currently at part chamber only will create additional accommodation for the enjoyment of the owners, namely media / cinema accommodation and a home gym with shower facilities.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT This application relates to the creation of a lightwell at the lower front elevation to provide natural light and air to the gym area.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT No consultation has been carried out in relation to this application.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT Our clients, the new owners, also are wishing to made the following improvements to the character of the property as a whole and demonstrate the level of investment in preserving the property and enhancing its significance as a positive contributor to the conservation area they have.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT • Refurbishment of all windows, removing rotten wood and ensuring all windows are able to open thus improving and restoring the external appearance of the property and ensuring the interior can be adequately ventilated protecting the building from future decay.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT • External painting of the windows and doors, in order to improve the external appearance of the property and protect external joinery.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT • Internally significant improvements have also been made including; a re-wire of the full house to current safety standards, re-plastering and re-instating period plasterwork and detailing.

Text: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT The previous owner had lived in the house and when he was forced to leave, left the house is a very serious dilapidated state of decay requiring immediate attention on public health grounds. Our client has already worked hard to clear many years of accumulated rubbish and belongings left to rot, alongside successfully eradicating the differing vermin that inhabited the skeletal structure of the property, which we are sure the neighbouring attached houses will be thankful of.

Text: SITE ACCESS SITE ACCESS

Text: SITE ACCESS The existing property benefits from one off-road vehicle parking space to the front of the property. There is insufficient width on the driveway for 2 vehicles as access is restricted by the existing stone pillars. The proposal is to slightly alter the pillars clear width apart by 300mm, thus allowing 2 vehicles access. A proposed low electronic bi-folding gate for security is also being requested.

Text: SITE ACCESS It is proposed that the site will retain access via the existing arrangement, therefore, it shall retain the existing properties arrangements with regard to convenient access for the dwelling, spaces and transport network.

Text: SITE ACCESS Access into and around the house will remain as existing with all new elements to be built in accordance with Building Regulations Approved Document Part M.

Text: IMPACT ON HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE IMPACT ON HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE

Text: IMPACT ON HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE The proposed alterations are designed to be aesthetically in keeping with the established Edwardian residential context & are well screened behind existing boundary treatments on all sides

Text: IMPACT ON HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE The proposals are therefore not considered to have any negative impact on either the Conservation Area or listed building.

Text: IMPACT ON NEIGHBOURING AMENITY IMPACT ON NEIGHBOURING AMENITY

Text: IMPACT ON NEIGHBOURING AMENITY The proposed development extends 6.2m back from the common rear building line with 76 The Downs. It is acknowledged that this is not in strict accordance with the local authority’s guidelines on dimensional limits of rear extensions.

Text: IMPACT ON NEIGHBOURING AMENITY However the normal limits on the depth of rear extensions are intended to limit overbearing to the adjacent garden spaces and ground floor windows. In this case, existing the boundary wall by 1.5m alongside setting it back slightly from the main rear elevation outrigger, to emphasis subservience, the overshadowing will be minimised.
