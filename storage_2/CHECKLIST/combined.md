### TRAFFORD COUNCIL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICE COUNCILINTRODUCTION

Trafford Council has produced this Application Validation Checklist in accordance with Planning PracticeG uidance (PPG) and paragraph 45 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).  Paragraph 45 of the NPPF states that local planning authorities should publish a list of their information requirements for applications, which should be kept to the minimum needed to make decisions and should be reviewed at least every two years.  Paragraph 45 states that local planning authorities should only request supporting information that is relevant, necessary and material to the application in question.  Planning Practice Guidance states that, in addition to being specified on an up-to-date local list published on the local planning authority's website, information requested with a particular planning application must be:

- reasonable having regard, in particular, to the nature and scale of the proposed development; and,
- about a matter which it is reasonable to think will be a material consideration in the determination of the application.

Once adopted, if the information which is required by the checklist is not included with an application and is considered by the Local Planning Authority to be reasonable and necessary in order to properly assess the application, the authority will be entitled to declare the application invalid.  Conversely applications which are validated are likely to contain sufficient information for a decision to be made and this should enable the Council to achieve a greater percentage of decisions within government timescales.  However, it must be recognised that there may still be situations arising where a validated application will not contain all the information required for a decision to be made and the Council may seek additional information post-validation under the existing statutory provisions set out within the Town and Country Planning (Application) Regulations 1998.

In circumstances where applicants do not agree with the Council's request for information or plans set out within this list, they may wish to challenge the decision not to validate an application.  In such cases, applicants may have the right of appeal for non-validation under Section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  The relevant grounds for the appeal would be non-determination within the 8or 13-week determination period (depending upon whether the application is minor or major).  Similarly, the right to complain to the Local Government Ombudsman on the grounds of maladministration also remains.

This document provides a number of checklists outlining requirements for each application type followed by guidance setting out the type and specific requirements of documents which may need to be submitted in support of any application to the planning authority.  Additionally, appendices provide further information. The requirements are listed as Essential or Criteria Based. Essential requirements must accompany all applications of that type while Criteria Based requirements are subject to site specific constraints (criteria details are italicised beside the requirement).

All documents submitted to accompany an application must be proportionate to the scale of development that permission/consent is being sought for.

Where an application site is located within an area covered by a Masterplan, Development Framework or Area Action Plan, applicants will also be required to comply with the information requirements set out in the relevant document.

The Council encourages applicants to seek pre-application advice.  This is particularly useful for larger and more complex schemes.  If the Council declares an application invalid, it will normally set out its reasons in writing to the applicant or agent within 5-10 working days.  If all the information required has been received the application will be considered as valid from the date of its receipt.

## General Points:

1. Plans and Elevations will be checked for consistency.  Any significant discrepancies will result in the application being invalid;
2. Plans must be marked with a recognisable standard metric scale and a scale bar;
3. Plans must be clearly drawn, numbered, dated and identify the address to which they relate;
4. Plans that are marked 'do not scale' or with similar disclaimers will not be accepted and will result in the application being invalid;
5. If an apparently valid application is later found to be invalid following registration, the original start date for processing the application will be disregarded and the time from application to decision will start again.

### APPLICATION CHECKLISTS

The lists below set out the essential and criteria-based document requirements for each development type. These checklists ensure that the Council has the right level of information submitted with planning applications at the start of the process, which will aid the speed of decision making.

### HEDGEROW REMOVAL NOTICE NATIONAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS APPLICATION FEE APPLICATION FORMS

The correct fee, where one is necessary - see the Council's fee schedule and national planning guidance.

One copy of the completed Standard Application Form (1APP). The forms are available electronically and can be submitted via the planning portal. If the applicant wishes to submit a paper application, these can be printed off from the Council's website (Planning application forms (trafford.gov.uk) The electronic standard application form allows applicants to apply for multiple consents at the same time: for example, to apply for planning permission and listed building consent.

A completed Ownership and Agricultural Holdings Certificate. Under section 65(5) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, read in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14 of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (DMPO), the Local Planning Authority must not entertain an application for planning permission unless the relevant certificates concerning the ownership of the application site have been completed.

All applications except those for approval of reserved matters, discharge or variation of conditions, tree preservation orders and express consent to display an advertisement must include the appropriate certificate of ownership. The certificate also requires confirmation of whether or not the site relates to an agricultural holding. If the site does relate to an agricultural holding, all agricultural tenants must be notified prior to the submission of the application.

Certificate of Ownership

Certificate A is applicable when the applicant is the sole owner and when none of the land to which the application relates is, or is part of, an agricultural holding;

Certificate B is applicable when the owner and /or agricultural tenant is known to the applicant; and,

Certificates C and D are applicable when none or only some of the owners and / or agricultural tenants of the site are known. For this purpose, an 'owner' is anyone with a freehold interest, or leasehold interest, the unexpired term of which is not less than 7 years.

## Notice to owner

If Certificates B or C are relevant, the applicant must complete and serve notice of the proposals on the owners and /or agricultural tenants of the application site in accordance with Article 13 of the DMPO.

### DESIGN AND ACCESS STATEMENT

One copy of a Design and Access Statement must accompany all applications for both outline and full planning permission in accordance with Article 9 of the DMPO, as amended, in respect of the following categories of application:

- o Development which is major development;
- o Where any part of the development is in a 'designated area', development consisting of:
- (i) the provision of one or more dwellinghouses; or
- (ii) the provision of a building or buildings where the floor space created by the development is 100 square metres or more.

In this context, 'designated area' means a World Heritage Site or a Conservation Area.

Design and Access Statements accompanying applications for listed building consent must include an explanation of the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the proposed works, and how they have taken account of:

- a) the special architectural or historic importance of the building;
- b) the particular physical features of the building that justify its designation as a listed building; and,
- c) the building's setting.

Unless the proposed works only affect the interior of the building, Design and Access Statements accompanying applications for listed building consent must also explain how issues relating to access to the building have been dealt with. They must explain the applicant's approach to access, including what alternative means of access have been considered, and how relevant Local Plan policies have been taken into account. Statements must also explain how the applicant's approach to access takes account of matters (a)-(c) above.

Design and Access Statements accompanying applications for listed building consent must provide information on any consultation undertaken, and how the outcome of this consultation has informed the proposed works. Statements must also explain how any specific issues which might affect access to the building have been addressed.

Further information on what a Design and Access Statement is can be found in PPG.

The Trafford Design Code includes within it a number of references to compliance requirements which should be signposted within the Design and Access Statement if they are not contained in a standalone Design Code Compliance Statement.

### DRAWINGS AND PLANS

One copy of other drawings (dependent on the type of application - refer to the relevant checklist for specific requirements) and may include:

## Block Plan

Plan of the site at a scale of 1:100 or 1:200, showing the proposed development; any site boundaries; the type and height of any boundary treatment (e.g. walls and fences etc.); the position of any building or structure on the other side of such boundaries and with any proposed extensions clearly identified to scale.

## Elevations - Existing and Proposed

Plans drawn to a scale of 1:50 or 1:100. These must show clearly the proposed works in relation to what is already there. All sides of the proposal must be shown in full (not part) and these must indicate, the proposed building materials and the style, materials and finish of windows and doors. Blank elevations must also be included; if only to show that this is in fact the case.  Where a proposed elevation adjoins another building or is in close proximity, the drawings must clearly show the relationship between the buildings, and detail the positions of the openings on each property.

## Floor Plans - Existing and Proposed

Plans drawn to a scale of 1:50 or 1:100. These must show the proposal in detail. Where existing internal and external walls are proposed to be demolished they must clearly be identified in red. The drawings submitted must show details of the existing building(s) as well as those for the proposed development. New buildings must also be shown in context with adjacent buildings (including property numbers where applicable).

## Roof Plans - Existing and Proposed

Plans drawn to a scale of 1:50 or 1:100. A roof plan is used to show the shape of the roof. Details such as the roofing material and their location must be specified on the roof plan.

## Site Sections and Finished Floor and Site Levels - Existing and Proposed

Plans drawn to a scale of 1:50 or 1:100. These must show a cross section(s) through the proposed building(s). In all cases where a proposal involves a change in ground levels, illustrative drawings must be submitted to show both existing and finished levels and to include details of foundations and eaves and how encroachment onto adjoining land is to be avoided. Cross sections must be submitted where basement car parking is proposed.

Site level surveys (topographical surveys) are required to identify natural and artificial topographic features and ground levels and must be submitted to demonstrate how proposed buildings relate to existing site levels, features and neighbouring development. Such plans must also show the proposals in relation to the adjoining buildings.

Finished floor levels for existing and proposed development must be clearly identified on plans.

In the case of householder development, the levels may be evident from floor plans and elevations, but particularly in the case of sloping sites it will be necessary to show how proposals relate to existing ground levels or where ground levels outside the extension would be modified. Levels must also be taken into account in the formulation of design and access statements.

## Site Location Plan

One copy of a Site Location Plan, based on an up-to-date map at a scale of 1:1250 or 1:2500 and scaled to fit onto A4 or A3 size paper, showing the direction of north. Plans should wherever possible show at least two named roads and the surrounding buildings. The properties shown should be numbered or named to ensure that the exact location of the application site is clear.

The application site must be edged clearly with a red line. It must include all land necessary to carry out the proposed development - for example, land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, landscaping, car parking and open areas around buildings. A blue line must be drawn around any other land owned by the applicant, close to or adjoining the application site.

## Site Plan

One copy of a Site Plan, drawn at a scale of at 1:500 or 1:200 accurately showing:

- a)  The direction of north;
- b)  The proposed development in relation to the site boundaries and other existing buildings on the site, with written dimensions including those to the boundaries;
- c)  All the buildings, roads and footpaths on land adjoining the site including access arrangements;
- d)  The species, position and spread of all trees within 12 metres of any proposed building works;
- e)  The extent and type of any hard surfacing;
- f) Boundary treatment including walls or fencing where this is proposed.

## Streetscene Elevations

Plans drawn to a scale of 1:100 or 1:200. A streetscene elevation should be submitted in all cases where the proposal is for an infill development between existing buildings, for an increase in the height of an existing property within a row of other buildings and for all streets within major developments.

## Tree Location Plan (relevant for Applications for Tree Works only)

The plan should show boundaries and adjoining properties (including house numbers or names) and names of roads. It is not necessary to draw a scale plan, but the plans should show approximate distances between the tree(s) in question and other relevant features and include a north arrow.

## Hedgerow Location Plan (relevant for Applications for Hedgerow Removal Notice only)

A plan drawn to scale (ideally 1:2500) which clearly shows the location and length of the hedgerow(s) to be removed.  The plan should include a north arrow.

All drawings must have a scale bar and be clearly referenced with a drawing title, north point, reference number and details of any revisions.

### GATEWAY ONE FIRE STATEMENT

A Planning Gateway One Fire Statement is required to be submitted as a result of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure and Section 62A Applications) (England) (Amendment) Order 2021 ('the 2021 Order').

A Planning Gateway One Fire Statement must be included for all applications for full planning permission which involve the:

- provision of one or more relevant buildings, or
- development of an existing relevant building or
- development within the curtilage of a relevant building.

Relevant buildings are those which contain two or more dwellings or educational accommodation and meet the height condition (18m or more in height, or 7 or more storeys whichever is reached first).

Fire Statements must be submitted on the standard form on GOV.UK (or a form to similar effect).  Guidance on the completion of a fire statement is available on GOV.UK.

Applications for planning permission will be exempt from the requirement to submit a fire statement where:

- -the application is for a material change in use of a relevant building and the material change of use would result in the building no longer being a relevant building
- -the application is for a material change in use of land or buildings within the curtilage of a relevant building and the material change of use would not result in the provision of one or more relevant buildings
- -the application is for outline planning permission
- -the application is for permission to develop land without compliance with conditions under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990

Where applications for outline planning permission seek approval for layout and scale and involve the provision of one or more relevant buildings, or the development of an existing relevant building or the development within the curtilage of a relevant building a fire statement will be required to be submitted.

Further guidance on the requirements of Planning Gateway One is provided in the relevant section of the NPPG.

### LOCAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS ACCOMMODATION SCHEDULE

Threshold - Requirement for Full or Outline planning applications for residential development

Required by Policy JP-H3 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The accommodation schedule should set out the size of the proposed residential units. A comparison should also be made to the Nationally Described Space Standards.

### ACCURATE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS (AVR)

Threshold - AVRs will be required where a proposal is likely to have a significant effect on designated and non-designated heritage assets; and/or the surrounding townscape/landscape.

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

An Accurate Visual Representation (AVR) is a form of computer visualisation that can assist in the assessment of the visual effects of specific proposals on designated views. AVR images are very realistic and should be accurate with respect to height, form, size and location and should be created to a high level of verifiable accuracy using collected survey data, precise photography and a strict recorded methodology.

Early pre-application discussions are encouraged to determine whether AVR images are required to support a proposal and, where necessary, which views are required and the extent to which they should be rendered.

AVR's should be completed in accordance with the latest relevant Landscape Institute guidance 'Visual Representation of development proposals'.

## AFFORDABLE HOUSING STATEMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full or Outline planning applications for housing developments proposing 10 or more residential units or where the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more in 'hot' market locations (Altrincham and open countryside) and 'moderate' market locations (Sale, Urmston and Stretford) and 15 or more residential units in 'cold' market locations (Partington, Carrington and Old Trafford).

Required by Policy L2 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JPA 3.2 and JPA-30 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

This statement must include the following elements: -

- The number of affordable residential units;
- The mix of affordable units in terms of type, (intermediate / social rented) and size (number of bedrooms and gross floorspace);
- Plans showing the location of affordable housing units;
- How the affordable housing units are to be managed and, where this involves an RSL, their details.

Where the developer proposes a lower proportion of affordable housing or a different mix to that outlined within Policy L2 of the Trafford Core Strategy, then detailed justification should be provided to support the proposal within this statement.

For outline applications where it is not possible to specify the affordable housing provision in detail, a statement of intent should be submitted outlining how affordable housing is intended to be provided and whether the site will comply with the provisions set out.

Further details can be found within the Council's SPD1: Planning Obligations

### AIR QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full or Outline planning applications for the following:

- Developments affecting waste handling facilities (including sewerage treatment works or poultry farms);
- Any industrial activity which is regulated by the Local Authority or Environment Agency;
- Developments that introduce new exposure close to existing sources of air pollutants, including road traffic, industrial operations, agricultural operations etc.

In addition to the above, an Air Quality Assessment will be required if any of the criteria in A below apply together with any of the criteria in B and any of the criteria in C:

A.

10 or more residential units or a site area of more than 0.5ha more than 1,000 m2 of floor space for all other uses or a site area greater than 1ha

B.

the development has more than 10 parking spaces the development will have a centralised energy facility or other centralised combustion

process
Required by Policy L5 of Trafford Core Strategy, JP-S5 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The Air Quality Assessment must demonstrate how a development would affect pollution concentrations in relation to health based statutory and proposed air quality standards and objectives. This would normally involve screening and where appropriate dispersion modelling to:

- Assess the existing air quality in the study area (existing baseline);
- Predict the future air quality without the development in place (future baseline which may or may not include the contribution of committed development);
- Predict the future air quality with the development in place (with development);
- The cumulative impact of developments should be considered. It may be necessary to model another future scenario, with committed development excluded, to allow the cumulative impact of all such future developments with planning permission to be assessed as one combined impact at sensitive receptors. In most circumstances, it is more likely that committed development would be included in the future baseline where the information exists to facilitate this.

Applicants must be aware of the GM Clean Air Plan when undertaking any air quality assessment.

Further details can be found in the NPPF, NPPG, the Institute of Air Quality Management guidance document: Planning for Air Quality (2017) and the Greater Manchester Air Quality Action Plan. For further guidance or advice please contact the Council's Public Protection Department on 0161 9121377 or environmental.protection@trafford.gov.uk .

## Air Quality Assessment - Ecology

## Threshold - all development that may affect a Nationally, European or Internationally designated site

Required by Policy L5 of Trafford Core Strategy, JP-S5 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

When there is potential for air quality issues to affect a European/Internationally or Nationally designated site, an Air Quality Assessment will be required.

To determine whether an Air Quality Assessment is required, applicants should refer to the SSSI Impact Risk Zones tool - SSSI Impact Risk Zones (England)  Natural England Open Data Geoportal.  The results of screening should inform the need for any further, more detailed assessment which may be required to fully assess the impacts of the proposal.

If utilising the Simple Calculation of Atmospheric Impact Limits (SCAIL) model, ensure the final input file (PDF format), the outputs for the model and the results (CSV format), with the details of the application are attached. This is particularly of significance for applications involving slurry stores, manure stores, pig, cattle, poultry units and combustion related proposals.

If road traffic emissions will result in air quality impacts on designated sites, applicants should refer to Natural England's approach to advising competent authorities on the assessment of road traffic emissions under the Habitats Regulations (NEA001).

### BIODIVERSITY NET GAIN STATEMENT/PLAN

## Threshold - all development unless exempt

Required by Policy JP-G8 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The exemptions are set out in paragraph 17 of Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024.

Where an applicant considers that they meet the self-build exemption, confirmation must be provided that the development would comply with the definition of 'self-build and custom housebuilding' taken from the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (section 1(A1)).

Applicants are advised to review the Biodiversity Net Gain Guidance for Planners and Applicants produced by Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) when preparing their Biodiversity Net Gain Statement/Plan.

## The report must include:

- a statement as to whether the applicant believes that planning permission,
- if
- granted, would be subject to the biodiversity net gain condition;
- the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat on the date of application (or an earlier date and justification why the earlier date is being used)
- the completed metric calculation tool used showing the calculations, the publication date and version of the biodiversity metric used to calculate that value;
- a statement whether activities have been carried out prior to the date of application (or earlier proposed date), that result in loss of onsite biodiversity value ('degradation'), and where they have:
- -a statement to the effect that these activities have been carried out;
- -the date immediately before these activities were carried out;
- -the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat on this date;
- -the completed metric calculation tool showing the calculations, and
- -any available supporting evidence of this;
- a description of any irreplaceable habitat (as set out in column 1 of the Schedule to the Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Irreplaceable Habitat) Regulations 2024) on the land to which the application relates, that exists on the date of application, (or an earlier date);
- a plan, drawn to an identified scale which must show the direction of North, showing onsite habitat existing on the date of application (or an earlier date), including any irreplaceable habitat;
- a completed biodiversity metric indicating the level of biodiversity net gain or loss is likely to be achieved by the scheme;
- a written Biodiversity Net Gain Statement or draft Biodiversity Gain Plan;
- raw baseline habitat data in UKHab survey format, with condition assessment data; and,

pre- and post-development habitat maps showing areas of habitat retention and loss etc.

## Biodiversity Net Gain - Discharge of Condition Threshold - Requirement to discharge conditions, where applicable.

The information listed below will be required to support any application to discharge the biodiversity net gain condition.

- Ecological survey with raw baseline habitat data
- Completed baseline and post development habitat maps
- A finalised Biodiversity Gain Plan
- Completed and finalised Statutory Biodiversity Metric
- For offsite units or statutory credits - proof of purchase
- A completed Habitat Management and Monitoring Plan for all significant on-site gains

When a management and monitoring plan is submitted, the following criteria should be checked before submitting to LPA ecologists or GMEU for further review.

- Does it cover 30 years of management and monitoring?
- Has it been made clear who is responsible for the management? For example, is the responsibility being taken on by a management company who is clearly identified?
- Does the plan demonstrate when the monitoring will occur? Occurrence of
- monitoring visits will depend on the size of the site, but DEFRA has advised that a "medium sized habitat creation project might result in reports for years 2, 5,10, 20 and 30".

### COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY (CIL) - QUESTION FORM

Threshold - All planning applications that comprise any of the following:

- Development in excess of 100 square metres (GIA); or,
- Householder application for works or extension to a house; or,
- The creation of a new dwelling (also applies to development with less than 100 square metres (GIA); or.
- The conversion of a building.

CIL Charging Schedule approved by full council 26 March 2014

The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) allows Local Authorities in England and

Wales to set a financial levy on developments to provide essential infrastructure to support planned growth. Trafford's CIL Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule was approved by Council on 26 March 2014 and became effective on 07 July 2014.

All submissions that are for the above types of application must be accompanied by a completed CIL Question Form in order for the CIL Charging Authority to determine if an application is chargeable or not.

Further guidance on CIL can be found in the Council's document CIL Charging Schedule - Short Guide for Applicant's.

Note: If an applicant's email address is not provided on the Planning Application Form, the Council will issue all CIL related correspondence (including the CIL liability notice) to the agent (if applicable) via email.

### CONTAMINATED LAND ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Required if any of the following apply:

- The proposed end use of the development is considered sensitive to contamination (for example, allotments, residential use, schools, some commercial premises)
- The land is known or suspected of being contaminated
- There is no evidence to show the land is free of contamination
- Proposals may create new pollution linkages

Required by Policy JP-S1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) seeks to prevent unacceptable risks from pollution and land instability.  Where a site is affected by contamination or land stability issues, responsibility for securing safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner.

On a precautionary basis, the possibility of contamination should be assumed when considering individual planning applications in relation to all land subject to or adjacent to previous industrial use and also where uses are being considered that are particularly sensitive to contamination - e.g. housing, schools, hospitals, children's play areas.

The preliminary risk assessment (PRA) must be undertaken and prepared by a suitably qualified and experienced person and undertaken in accordance with relevant Land Contamination and Risk Management (LCRM) guidance and procedures. Details of authors and reviewers and their relevant competencies should be identified within the report.

If the site poses a potentially significant risk to the proposed use or wider environment, then a full site investigation is required to be submitted with any application.

The need for a PRA for householder applications, or applications for change of use which do not include operational development will be determined on a caseby-case basis.

Further details can be found in the NPPF and LCRM online guidance.

For further guidance or advice please contact the Council's Regulatory Services, environmental.protection@trafford.gov.uk.

### CONTEXT CHARACTER APPRAISAL

Threshold - all applications for new residential and non-residential development, except for householder applications, and applications for a change of use where there are no alterations to the appearance of the site or external appearance of a building).

Required by Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

It is important that applicants complete an appropriate Context Character Appraisal to establish the appropriate baseline for a building's design. A Context Character Appraisal should include consideration of:

- Scale, density, height and massing;
- Urban grain, layout and spaciousness;
- Topography;
- Streetscape;
- Impact on nearby heritage assets;
- Elevational treatment and local architectural style;
- Materials;
- Hard and soft landscaping, including boundary treatments;
- Landmark buildings;
- Skyline;
- Constraints and opportunities.

Where appropriate this appraisal can form part of a Design and Access Statement or form a standalone document.  The Context Character Appraisal must be clearly identified in the application submission.

Context Character Appraisals should be proportionate to the scale of the scheme.

### CRIME IMPACT STATEMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full, Outline and Reserved Matters applications for the following:

- Residential developments (Classes C1, C2, and C3 and C4 where 10 or more units are created (to include new development and changes of use)), or the development is to be carried out on a site having an

 area of 0.5 hectares or more and it is not known whether 10 houses or more will be developed; 
  
 • Development falling within Classes E, B2 and B8 and sui generis uses, where 1000m 2 gross or more of floorspace is proposed (to include new development, extensions of 1000m 2 or more and changes of use);  
 • Licensed food and beverage developments (within Class E or sui generis) where 200m 2 gross or more of floorspace is proposed (to include new development, extensions of 200m 2 or more, and changes of use); 
 • Casinos and amusement arcades (to include new development, extensions of 500m 2 or more, and changes of use); 
 • Development carried out on a site having an area of 1 hectare or more where the nature and amount of floorspace to be developed is not known; 
 • Car parks where 50 or more parking spaces are created. 

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Having considered the principles of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), and having referenced Police approved security products and standards, the Crime Impact Statement should demonstrate that a development has been designed to minimise the risk of crime and disorder affecting both the development and its immediate surroundings. Developers are strongly advised to discuss the proposals with Greater Manchester Police Design for Security.

## The Crime Impact Statement should:

- Be prepared by a suitably qualified and experienced professional that is able to offer impartial and objective crime prevention advice.
- Highlight all relevant crime and disorder issues currently experienced in the neighbourhood in which the development site is located, and any crime and disorder issues that the proposed development may generate or attract.
- Consider the crime and disorder issues, and include a review of how these issues might affect future both users of the development and the local community, and identify design solutions that will reduce the developments and the local community's vulnerability to crime and disorder, and promote a safe and secure development.

Where appropriate this statement can form part of a Design and Access Statement.

A statement detailing how the applicant has incorporated and taken on board the recommendations of the CIS should be provided. This can form part of the Design and Access Statement.

### DAYLIGHT / SUNLIGHT ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Required for all planning applications where the proposal is likely to have an adverse effect upon levels of light to adjoining sensitive land uses and future occupiers of the proposed scheme.

Required by Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Sunlight and daylight studies should assess the impact of a proposed scheme on the sunlight and daylight received by future occupiers of the proposed scheme and adjoining/neighbouring residential properties and buildings.

The Council will expect the impact of the development to be assessed following the methodology set out in the most recent edition of Building Research Establishment's (BRE) 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: A guide to good practice'.

The applicant is also required to provide a summary table for sunlight, and for daylight, which includes the following:

- the receptor (i.e. each building);
- the number of rooms in the receptor tested;
- the number of rooms which meet the BRE criteria;
- the number of rooms which do not meet the BRE criteria, split by minor,
- moderate and major significance, as per the criteria outlined above;
- the number of dwellings affected; and,
- commentary on minor, moderate and major sunlight and daylight losses.

Where amenity space is proposed as part of a development, a sun path study must also be undertaken to demonstrate that at least half of a development's amenity space receives at least two hours of sunlight on 21 st  March.

### DESIGN CODE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT

Threshold - all applications for new residential and non-residential development, except for householder applications.

Required by Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Trafford Design Code clearly sets out the design requirements for new residential and non-residential development in the Borough.  Each sub-section of the Code contains clear information on how applicants should seek to demonstrate to officers their project complies (or justify why not) with that design code section. This need not necessarily require the submission of a lengthy compliance document. Applicants may be able to demonstrate how they have complied with relevant codes within the Design and Access Statement, Façade Design Analysis or their own compliance statement. This will ensure the officer has all the relevant information and visual documentation to make the necessary decisions.

Where appropriate this statement can form part of a Design and Access Statement or form a standalone document and should be clearly identified in the submission.

Applicants may wish to use the Design Code Compliance Statement template at Appendix 1 to set out where particular code requirements are addressed within the application submission.

An 'employment use' may be defined as uses falling within Use Classes E (g), B2 and B8, as well as Sui Generis uses of a similar nature which may normally be found within employment areas.

### ENERGY STATEMENT

Threshold - Requirement for full and outline planning applications comprise:

- Two or more dwellings;
- The provision of more than 100m 2  (GIA) of non-residential floorspace

Required by Policy L5 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-S2 of Places for Everyone, Policy CQ4 of the Civic Quarter Area Action Plan and the NPPF

PfE aims to deliver a carbon neutral Greater Manchester no later than 2038 and there is an expectation that new development will, unless it can be demonstrated that it is not practicable or financially viable, be net zero carbon 1  either:

- from adoption - to regulated operational carbon emissions;
- from 2028 - to all emissions 'in construction'.

From 2025 development should also calculate and minimise carbon emissions from unregulated emissions alongside regulated emissions. Development proposals should set out how this has been achieved in an energy statement in accordance with the energy hierarchy, which in order of importance seeks to:

- Minimise energy demand;
- Maximise energy efficiency;
- Use renewable energy;
- Use low carbon energy; and
- Utilise other energy sources.

From 2025 any residual carbon emissions that cannot be fully mitigated on-site should be offset, in agreement with the relevant local planning authority through a financial contribution to a carbon offset fund.

As an interim measure, development should be consistent with the 2022 Part L Building Regulations unless superseded by changes to building regulations and/or national or local planning policies.

Further information regarding Carbon and Energy requirements can be found in the PfE Sustainable and Resilient Places chapter.

All applications for major developments within the Civic Quarter must also be accompanied by a zero-carbon plan.  See the Civic Quarter Area Action Plan for more information.

Energy Statements should be proportionate to the scale of the scheme.

On receipt of a request for a screening opinion, Trafford Council will consult the relevant internal departments and external organisations and respond to the request in writing within a period of three weeks unless a longer time period has been agreed in writing with the person making the request.

In addition to the above, Trafford Council will undertake a screening opinion on all relevant applications when submitted. It may be at this time that an EIA is requested. Where an applicant disagrees with the Council's decision they may appeal to the Secretary of State for a screening opinion.

Scoping Opinion - If you are clear that an EIA is required (by virtue of either Schedule 1 or Schedule 2) or this has been confirmed by way of a formal screening opinion then a request for a 'Scoping Opinion' can be submitted to the Local Planning Authority to determine the range of information which should be included in the Environmental Statement. A scoping opinion should include information as set out in Article 15 of the EIA Regulations 2017. The Local Planning Authority will consult the relevant organisations and respond to requests within five weeks unless a longer time period has been agreed in writing with the person making the request.

All Environmental Statements (ES) should be prepared by a competent expert and be supported by a non-technical summary. Technical appendices should also be included where relevant.

### EQUALITIES STATEMENT

 Development Proposals on sites of 1ha. or above within Low Probability (Flood Zone 1) 
 Development Proposals on sites of 0.5ha. or above within Critical Drainage Areas as identified in the Council's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
 Development Proposals within Canal Hazard Zones or where flood risk from canals is otherwise considered to be an issue as identified in the Council's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 

Required by Policy L5 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-S4 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Details of Flood Zones can be found on the Environment Agency's website

The Council's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) is available via this link. All developers should provide information to demonstrate that:

- (i) account has been taken of flood risk from all sources (including rivers, canals, sewers, surface water run-off and groundwater), as identified in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment;
- (ii) the proposed development incorporates flood mitigation and management measures appropriate to the use and location;
- (iii) water efficiency will be improved and surface water run-off reduced through the use of appropriate measures such as rain water harvesting, water recycling and other Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) appropriate to the location, as mapped in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment.

The Council has produced a checklist and guidance note to assist applicants further in submitting the required flood risk information alongside planning applications.  These can be found at Appendices 3 and 4 of this checklist. Where formal Flood Risk Assessments (FRAs) are required, it is acknowledged that they will vary in their detail and technical complexity to reflect the scale, nature and location of the proposed development. Whilst FRAs will need to cover the same general matters applicable to all development proposals, they will normally be expected to contain a much greater degree of information - including supporting survey and modelling data, incorporating allowances for climate change - and to have been undertaken under the supervision of an experienced flood risk management specialist. The Environment Agency has prepared

Standing Advice to assist developers with the specific information that should be included in formal FRAs submitted to local planning authorities.

The attention of all applicants is drawn to the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework (paragraphs 167 - 173) relating to the need for a flood risk Sequential Test and Exception Test to be undertaken, where necessary, for development proposals.

Information on the production of Drainage Strategies/Statements can be found in the relevant section of this checklist.

### GREEN BELT IMPACT STATEMENT
Required by Policy R4 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-G9 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Only limited types of development are considered to be 'appropriate' in the Green Belt (See paragraphs 154 - 156 of the NPPF) for definitions of 'appropriate' development).

If your proposal is not one of the purposes listed as 'appropriate' development in the NPPF, it will be considered 'inappropriate'. If this is the case and the application site falls within the designated Green Belt then you must include in your application a statement of the 'very special circumstances' that you consider justify the development. The LPA will not treat an application for 'inappropriate development' in the Green Belt as valid unless accompanied by a Green Belt Impact Statement which outlines the 'very special circumstances'. Further advice is provided within the NPPF.

For the avoidance of doubt, 'grey belt' land is considered to be land in the Green Belt.

### GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE STATEMENT

- Development which involves alterations to or demolition of a Listed Building
- Development affecting the setting of a Listed Building
- Development within or affecting the setting of a Conservation Area
- Development that involves the alteration or demolition of a nondesignated heritage asset
- Development affecting the setting of a non-designated heritage asset
- Development within historic parks or gardens and setting
- Development on sites that are of archaeological interest
- Development of any other site which includes any buildings/structures considered to be a Heritage Asset.

Required by Policy R1 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P2 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The Heritage Assessment must include a two-stage process; an assessment of the significance of the affected heritage asset(s) and the impact of the proposed development on that significance including any measures to mitigate potential harm and/or better reveal significance.

## Assessment of Significance

The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the heritage asset and applications should not be validated unless the extent of impact on significance is clear from the information available. As a minimum, the relevant historic environment record held by the Greater Manchester Archaeological

Advisory Service should have been consulted and the heritage assets assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary. Where a site on which a development is proposed includes or has the potential to include heritage assets with archaeological interest, applicants will be required to submit a desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation.

The applicant may also find it helpful to consult Chapter 16 of the NPPF and Historic England's Historic Environment Good Practice Advice notes should also be consulted when undertaking a Heritage Assessment to accompany an application.

## Impact of the Proposed Development - General Requirements

The second stage of the Heritage Assessment must clearly set out the proposed development and the impact of the proposed development on the significance of the affected heritage assets(s). It should include the details of the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the works including consideration of the scale, massing, height, siting, layout, appearance, character, materiality and any potential new use. The impact assessment should demonstrate how the proposals have taken account of the historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic significance of the designated or nondesignated heritage asset, including setting, and indicate clearly how the proposal will positively contribute to local character and distinctiveness.

The assessment should include the following where relevant:

- Schedule of works, method statement and materials to be used for the proposals;
- Demolition floor plans and elevations as well as a structural survey clearly demonstrating how any retained building or structure will be supported during the course of the works;
- A structural survey will be required in support of an application if the proposal involves demolition or development which may affect the structural stability of buildings/structures identified as Heritage Assets (i.e. Listed Buildings or historic buildings in Conservation Areas);
- Any relevant professional assessments (accredited) of the property that will assist the proposal e.g. Structural Report, Fire Strategy, Heat and Ventilation Report;
- Any information provided by contractors/companies supplying materials;
- Labelled photographic record if relevant;
- Historic phasing plans;
- A copy of the listing description. Listing descriptions can be obtained from the National Heritage List for England on the following website: Search the List Find listed buildings, monuments, battlefields and more  Historic England

Heritage Assessments are also required to describe the purpose and need for the proposed alterations, justifying why this option has been adopted as opposed to possible alternatives in order to minimise the potential harm to the heritage asset(s). The Heritage Assessment should demonstrate how the proposals are designed to minimise the impacts on the layout and architectural detailing and complement the external and/or internal features of the historic original building. Opportunities to better reveal or enhance significance of heritage assets should also be explored.

## Development which involves alterations to a Listed Building or a Non-designated Heritage Asset

A statement of significance should demonstrate how the proposals are designed to minimise the impacts on the layout and architectural detailing and complement the external and/or internal features of the historic original building. Any proposals affecting the special architectural or historic interest of the interior of a listed building will require an application for listed building consent. Where consent is sought for a number of proposals a detailed schedule of works, method statement and list of materials in addition to the relevant measured drawings, should be submitted with the application.

Where the demolition or rebuilding of a listed building or non-designated heritage asset is proposed, the application should be accompanied by relevant professional assessments (CARE or conservation accredited) i.e. a detailed survey of the building or structure affected, a full structural assessment, any relevant timber and damp surveys with accompanying recommendations and a specification of works. Floor plans and elevations indicating the level of alteration or demolition will also be required as well as a structural survey clearly demonstrating how any remaining building or structure will be supported during the course of the works.

Proposed works to specific elements of a building or structure such as windows, doors, eaves details, shop fronts, or for example, internal decorative plasterwork, joinery, fireplaces, floor coverings, boundary treatments or building construction methods especially where they are unusual in some way, will require detailed measured drawings. Depending on the feature being illustrated, the scale should be at 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20.

## Development within the curtilage of or affecting the setting of Listed Buildings, Scheduled Ancient Monuments or Historic Parks and Gardens

Assessments for developments which are proposed within the curtilage of or affect the setting of a Listed Building, scheduled Ancient monument, Historic Parks and Gardens (within or affecting the setting of) must include a statement of any impacts. The assessment must include design principles and concepts that have been applied including consideration of the impact, scale, massing, siting, layout, appearance, character, materials and any potential new use. As above, the application must include a statement of significance, which demonstrates an understanding of the historical, archaeological, architectural and artistic interest of the affected buildings or site and demonstrate how the proposals preserve and enhance the character. In addition to the measured drawings required, streetscene plans may also be required, where new development is proposed, to clearly illustrate the local context, the potential impact of the development on the skyline, roofscape views and vistas as well as proposed boundary treatments. Applications which will impact on more significant assets, multiple heritage assets, or changes considered likely to have a major effect on significance will require a more detailed analysis of views and setting and may require a 'Zone of Theoretical Visibility' or the scope of potential viewpoints agreed with the local planning authority.

## Applications for development within or affecting the setting of a Conservation Area

Assessments for development affecting (within or adjacent to) Conservation Areas should address how the proposal has been designed to have regard to the character and/or appearance of the conservation area and to explain how the proposal enhances or preserves its character or appearance with reference to the relevant Conservation Area Appraisal (CAA) and Conservation Area Management Plan (CAMP) (SPD5). In addition to the measured drawings required, streetscene plans may also be required where new development is proposed to clearly illustrate the local context, the potential impact of the development on the skyline, roofscape views and vistas as well as proposed boundary treatments.

A structural survey will be required in support of the demolition of any buildings in Conservation Areas and, where relevant, a viability appraisal, which should include an analysis of the current value, an analysis of the detailed costs of repair, alteration and extension and the likely end value of the building. A financial comparison should be provided between this option and the option for redevelopment including demolition. The application should include demolition floor plans and elevations as well as a structural survey clearly demonstrating how the remaining building will be supported during the course of the works. Where an applicant is seeking to justify the demolition of a building on the basis that a replacement building will contribute more positively to the area than the building being removed, the statement must include a justification of how the design of the new building is equal to or more successful than the building being replaced.

## Applications for development on sites with an archaeological interest

Where a development site includes or has the potential to include heritage assets with archaeological interest, applicants will be required to submit an archaeological desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation. As a minimum, the Historic Environment Record held by the Greater Manchester Archaeological Advisory Service should have been consulted and the archaeological interest assessed using appropriate expertise.

A desk-based assessment will determine, as far as is reasonably possible from existing records, the nature, extent and significance of the archaeological interest within the proposed development site. It will aim to establish the impact of the proposed development on that significance, and will enable reasoned decisions to be made on whether to mitigate, offset or accept that impact without further intervention. In certain circumstances the desk-based work may identify a need for further evaluation, such as fieldwalking, geophysical survey, metal-detecting surveys or intrusive investigation, to determine the potential impact of development on the archaeological resource, and the results submitted as part of the application.

Desk-based assessments shall be undertaken in accordance with the 'Standard and guidance for historic environment desk-based assessment guidance' set out by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA), and in consultation with the local authority's historic environment advisers in advance of research to seek to agree the aims and methodology to ensure that unnecessary work is avoided and that the results are able to inform the planning process.

### HOUSING NEEDS STATEMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full and Outline planning applications for the following:

- Residential development consisting of 10 dwellings or more or with a site area of 0.5 hectares or more where the number of dwellings is not yet known.

Threshold - Requirement for all buildings that would be significantly higher than their neighbours or make a recognisable impact on the skyline or where sites are considered to be particularly sensitive, in landscape/townscape or visual terms.

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

A Landscape/Townscape and Visual Appraisal should follow the methodology set out in the Guidelines on Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment.  A LVA typically follows the format of an LVIA but, by definition, does not consider significance, with no requirement to give a judgement on the significance of effects.

Further guidance can be found in the Landscape Institute's Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 3rd Edition - May 2013 and Technical Guidance Note 1/20

Any development that is likely to trigger the requirement for a L/TVA should be discussed through pre-application discussions with the LPA.  Applicants should ensure that the location of viewpoints and visualisation type to be provided has been agreed with the LPA.

### LANDSCAPE / TOWNSCAPE VISUAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Requirement for all EIA development where the proposal would likely have significant environmental effects on the landscape/townscape.

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The Landscape / Townscape Visual Impact Assessment should follow the methodology set out in the Guidelines on Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment and identify the effects of the development on landscape and townscape as a resource in its own right and on specific views and general visual amenity experienced by people, including the cumulative effects of the proposed development in conjunction with other developments.

Further guidance can be found in the Landscape Institute's Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 3rd Edition - May 2013 and Technical Guidance Note 1/20

See Environmental Impact Assessment for further information on EIA screening/scoping and Environmental Statements.

Any development that is likely to trigger the requirement for a L/TVIA should be discussed through pre-application discussions with the LPA.  Applicants should ensure that the location of viewpoints and visualisation type to be provided has been agreed with the LPA.

- Mixed use development where the thresholds above would be exceeded cumulatively.

Required by Policy JP-J1 of Places for Everyone.

If the development falls within the criteria above, a Local Labour Agreement will be required. It should set out the intended approach to the following matters, for the construction phase and - for commercial development - also for the operational phase:

- Creation of apprenticeships/new entrants/graduates/traineeships;
- Recruitment through The Trafford Job Club, Jobcentre Plus and other local employment vehicles;

- The introduction of new materials on existing buildings.

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

A detailed materials schedule must provide details of all materials to be used on external facades (including mortar colour), roofs and rainwater goods.  The specification must include details of the manufacturer, type, texture, surface finish and colour of the materials.  Where stone is proposed, quarry details should be included.  The schedule must also clearly indicate where each material is proposed to be used.

## M4(2) / M4(3) COMPLIANCE STATEMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full or Outline planning applications for residential development

Required by Policy JP-H3 of Places for Everyone

All applications for residential development are required to demonstrate that all dwellings will be built to the 'accessible and adaptable' standard in Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations unless specific site conditions make this impracticable.

Where a development does not comply with M4(2) / M4(3) standards as required, applicants must provide detailed justification explaining why these standards cannot be met, including, details of which specific criteria of M4(2) the development cannot comply with, and the reasons why not.  Where appropriate, this statement can be included in a Design and Access Statement.

### NOISE ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full and Outline planning applications for the following:

- Development that generates significant levels of noise or vibration, such as industrial or commercial developments using noisy machinery (e.g. joinery workshops, refrigeration and extraction plant and equipment), noisy sports, bars and nightclubs etc.
- Development of noise sensitive uses (e.g. housing) adjacent to potentially significant sources of noise such as roads, railways, entertainment venues, commercial and industrial premises

Required by Policy L5 of Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

For further technical advice regarding the scope and content of a noise assessment, please contact the Council's Public Protection Department on 0161 912 1377 or environmental.protection@trafford.gov.uk.

### OPEN SPACE ASSESSMENT

Threshold - Requirement for Full and Outline Planning applications for the following:

- Development affecting land allocated as Protected Open Space or any other recreational (formal and informal) open space and buildings

Required by Policy R5 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policies JP-G6 and JP-P7 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Open space, sports and recreational buildings and land should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken which clearly shows the land/buildings to be surplus to requirements. For open space, 'surplus to requirements' should include consideration of all the functions that open space can perform. In the unlikely circumstance that a specific sport or recreation facility or provision has not been assessed in the Council's Green and Open Space: Assessment of Need (June 2009), the applicant must provide an independent assessment which should be accompanied by plans showing any areas of existing or proposed open space within or adjoining the application site. Applicants will need to agree the scope of any such assessment with the council, and consult the local community to demonstrate that their proposals are widely supported by them. Reference should be made to the Council's Green and Open Spaces - An Assessment of Need dated June 2009.

Further guidance is available within the NPPF.

Where playing fields are affected Sport England are a consultee and require certain information to be submitted.  Sport England recommends that planning applications affecting playing fields should  provide specific information in line with the requirements  of  Appendix  5. This  indicates  the  information  that  Sport  England recommends should be submitted where an applicant feels their development may meet with one of the exceptions to Sport England's Playing Fields Policy.

### PARAMETER PLANS

## Threshold - Requirement for Outline planning applications

Required by Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

The plans should indicate where buildings, roads and open space may be located on the site, the distribution of uses across the site and maximum heights (Above Ordnance Datum) and maximum footprints (length and width) of each development plot.

### PLANNING OBLIGATION DRAFT HEADS OF TERMS

Threshold - Requirement for Full and Outline planning applications for the following:

- Implementation of any off-site mitigation measures as identified within a Transport Assessment
- Delivery mechanism for affordable housing as identified within an Affordable Housing Assessment
- Any other developments where it is deemed necessary for a legal agreement to be used to secure infrastructure or services

Required by Core Strategy Policy L8, Policies JP-D1 and JP-D2 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Planning obligations (or section 106 agreements) are private agreements negotiated between local planning authorities and persons with an interest in a piece of land (or developers), and are intended to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms.

Where a legal agreement is needed to secure infrastructure or affordable housing in line with revised SPD1 Planning Obligations 2014, a planning obligation draft heads of terms should be submitted with the planning application. The applicant must provide their solicitor's full contact details, proof of title and identification of other ownership interests with their submission.

A payment will be required to cover the administrative costs of the Council's Legal Team.

### PLANNING STATEMENT

## Threshold - Requirement for Full and Outline planning applications

A  statement  which  identifies  the  context  for  a  proposed  development  providing information  and  evidence  to  show  how  the  proposed  development  accords  with relevant  Development  Plan  policies,  Supplementary  Planning  Documents  and Guidance, the NPPF and PPG. It should also:

- List all supporting documents;
- Describe the site and surroundings;
- Describe and explain the proposed development;
- Show  how  it  accords  with  the  relevant  national  and  local  policy,  standards, guidelines and supplementary guidance;
- Describe consultations that have taken place with the local planning authority, the wider community and statutory consultees at the pre-application stage and what account has been taken of the outcome of such consultations;
- Include  any  other  information  that  is  materially  relevant  to  the  proposed development but is not included in other submission document or in a Design and Access; and,
- Where special circumstances form part of the justification  for  a  development, these should be clearly set out and accompanied by relevant, verifiable evidence. The length and complexity of the Statement should be tailored to the scale and type of proposed development.

Planning Statements should be proportionate to the scale of development.

### SITE WIDE LANDSCAPE STRATEGY

Threshold - Required for all Full, Outline and Reserved Matters applications that comprise new build development.

Required by Policy JP-P1 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

Applicants are required to demonstrate how their scheme meets the principle of landscape-led development.

Landscape-led schemes should:

- Appraise and consider the context of the development site to retain and enhance landscape across the site.
- Provide clear and direct links to nearby existing amenities and green infrastructure (off site), creating green corridors to form a network of open spaces, and place the buildings around these corridors.
- Consider Biodiversity Net Gain.
- Include defined and useable open space within the development.
- Design SuDS to be an integral part of the development's green open space-network.
- Incorporate existing green infrastructure (on site) and natural habitats within proposals and create new ones where not.
- Specify site appropriate plant species in the design of open space and consider the long-term maintenance and delivery of trees and planting.
- Understand and describe how green infrastructure and landscape design will be delivered and phased.

Whilst a Site Wide Landscape Strategy is required for all developments, they should be proportionate to the scale of the scheme.

A Site Wide Landscape Strategy is made up of a number of documents and should include those listed below as a minimum.

Whilst it is expected that all applications for outline planning permission will be accompanied by a full Site Wide Landscape Strategy, it is acknowledged that the level of information that can be provided will depend on which matters approval is sought for.  If an outline planning application seeks permission for 'Landscaping' a full Site Wide Landscape Strategy should be submitted.  It is expected that all outline applications will as a minimum be accompanied by an assessment of the existing landscape character, site/topography plan, sun path study, and where there are existing utilities, a utilities plan.

## Landscape Masterplan

Plan showing the layout, character, structure and types of proposed planting, indicative planting list, details of all existing and proposed boundary treatments, details of all existing and proposed hard landscape including hard standing / parking areas. The plan should also illustrate how SuDS provision has informed the Masterplan.

A landscape appraisal must inform the landscape masterplan, this is particularly important for sites where there are existing landscape and topographical features.

## Site / Topography Plan

For sites where there is variance in site levels and there are existing landscape features, a Site/Topographical Plan should be provided identifying site levels and features at a scale of 1:500.

For proposals that require earth grading and moving, including bunds or SuDS features, the following existing and proposed plans will be required:

Site sections (at scale 1:100/1:200/1:500)

Contour plan (at scale 1:100/1:200/1:500)

Profile (soil/spoil) drawing (at scale 1:50/1:100/1:200)

## Hard and Soft Landscape Plan

Full details of the hard and soft landscape works must be provided, and include but not necessarily limited to:

- Details of existing and proposed levels for all external earthworks associated with the landscape proposals (including SuDS). Such details to include cross sections where necessary and their relationship to adjoining surfaces
- A general arrangement plan to include existing trees and hedgerows to be removed, those to be retained and details of proposed new trees and hedgerows
- All planting and seeding should be illustrated on plan accompanied by schedules specifying species, planting size, densities and plant numbers. Species selection should be informed by a soil analysis
- Planting bed dimensions must be annotated on the drawings
- Planting method statement
- Sections to illustrate the interface of hard surfaced areas with planting beds, including gradings and retaining features
- Tree pit (including soil volume), and staking / underground guying details
- Hard surfacing materials - layout, colour, size, texture, coursing, levels
- Walls, steps, fencing, gates, railings or other supporting structures location, type, heights and materials
- A Site Features Protection Plan
- Location and details of all street furniture
- Details of play equipment, including layout surface and boundary treatment
- Details of public art, if proposed
- Hostile Vehicle Mitigation measures, if necessary

## Sun path study

Where amenity space is proposed as part of a development, a sun path study must also be undertaken to demonstrate that at least half of the development's amenity space receives at least two hours of sunlight on March 21st.

## Utilities Plan

A Landscape Plan showing the co-ordination between existing and proposed planting in relation to utilities and underground services.

## Landscape Management and Maintenance Plan

Effective management of all manner of landscape infrastructure is essential to ensure long-term success.  A Landscape Management and Maintenance Plan sets out how a development will maintain the retained landscape and existing ecology of the site. It should include plans to ensure the designed landscape fulfils its roles, including providing habitats and recreational space.

The report should detail in one concise document the aims and objectives of the various landscape components and the mechanisms that will be put in place to ensure its delivery.  It should also include hard landscape features which contribute to the framework around which the soft landscape is based. Paving, lighting and fencing also need maintenance so that they remain safe, attractive and fit for purpose. Maintenance details of all of these will be required.

The detail and complexity of the document should reflect the scheme to which it refers. A large scheme which includes specialist habitat creation aimed at sustaining particular species will require a lot more detail than a plan which deals solely with a public open space with trees and shrubs.

## What to include in your plan

The report should include management details, maintenance details and accompanying plans.

## Management details

The following information must be provided in relation to the site and proposed development.

- Overall vision for the designed landscape
- Management responsibilities

- Failed component re-design and installation liabilities, responsibilities and timings
- Play areas - installation, inspection, maintenance and operation must conform to the BS EN1176 standard for playground equipment. Any thirdparty maintenance contractors must provide their maintenance regime for inclusion in this document
- Procedures must be included for replacement for decommissioned, broken or failed equipment. This replacement equipment will be of similar play value
- Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDs) details, including maintenance details and any specialist operations

## Maintenance details

Maintenance details are an essential part of the landscape management and maintenance plan.  The following information about the planned maintenance of the site must be provided.

- Maintenance details of boundary walls, fencing, bollards, and any temporary protective fencing such as post and wire/chestnut palings and knee rails and timing of removal, where these fall outside of a residential curtilage for an individual plot

 Residential Institutions (C2) - Education Students <50 students >50 students =TS >150 students = TA  >150 students 
 Residential Residents  <250 >250 >400 

Required by Policy L4 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-C8 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF
A TP is a package of measures produced by developers/employers to encourage staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car-use whilst a TA is a comprehensive and systematic process that sets out any transport issues relating to the proposed development. This document should identify what measures will be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the scheme and to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport. In some cases, the transport issues arising out of development proposals may not require a full TA and in these instances, a simplified report in the form of a TS will be required. If a TA is required, this should consider the level of traffic to be generated and its potential impact on existing highways and identify any necessary mitigation measures. It should also demonstrate that the development has made adequate provision for access by walking and cycling and has considered links to public transport and any necessary public transport improvements.

If you would like to discuss the scope of a required TA, TS or TP, please contact the Council's Highway Department at traffordtrafficlhaconsultations@amey.co.uk.

Where a site is in close proximity to the strategic road network (SRN), developments which typically fall under the usual threshold for a TA/TS may, in certain circumstances require a TA/TS due to the potential for developments to severely impact the SRN.  Where an applicant is required to assess the impact of their development on the SRN, they are advised to consult National Highways at PlanningNW@nationalhighways.co.uk at pre-application stage to attain advice on how they should proceed.

Further information on National Highways requirements can be found here:

- https://nationalhighways.co.uk/our-roads/planning-and-the-strategic-roadnetwork-in-england/
- DfT Circular 01/2022
- Planning for the Future: A Guide to Working with National Highways on Planning Matters

Threshold - Any development that falls below the thresholds set out in the box above but generates additional parking demand

Relevant details (e.g. numbers of staff / pupils / bedrooms / amount of floorspace etc.) will be required to allow the proposals to be properly assessed against the Council's car, cycle and motorcycle parking standards. These are contained within SPD3: Parking Standards and Design.

### TREE / ARBORICULTURAL SURVEY

Threshold - Requirement for Full, Householder, Outline and Reserved Matters applications for the following:

Where there are trees within the application site, or on land adjacent to it that could influence or be affected by the development (including street trees).

Required by Policy R2 of the Trafford Core Strategy and Policy JP-G7 of Places for Everyone

Information will be required on which trees are to be retained including a method statement outlining the means of how trees will be protected during construction. This information should be prepared by a suitably qualified and an experienced arboriculturist. Full guidance on the survey information, protection plan and method statement that should be provided with the application is set out in the current BS5837 'Trees in relation to construction'.

## Trees - Application for Tree Works

Threshold - Applications for tree works: works to trees subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) or notification of proposed works to trees in a Conservation Areas (CA)

Required by Policy R2 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policy JP-G7 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

For works to trees subject to a Tree Preservation Order, the following must be provided:

- Completed and dated application form, with all [mandatory] questions answered;
- Sketch plan showing the location of all tree(s);
- A full and clear specification of the works to be carried out
- Statement of reasons for the proposed work; and
- Evidence in support of statement of reasons, where required by the standard application form.

For notification of works to trees in conservation areas, it is important to supply precise and detailed information on your proposal. The following must be provided:

- Sketch plan showing the location of all tree(s); and
- A full and clear specification of the works to be carried out.

You may wish to include these details on the Standard application form.

Where the trees are protected by a TPO or in a conservation area, please indicate which of the following types of additional information you are submitting:

- Report by a tree professional (arboriculturist) or other (surveyor or engineer for alleged subsidence).
- Details of any assistance or advice sought from a Local Planning Authority officer prior to submitting this form

### VIABILITY ASSESSMENTS

All planning applications where a developer considers that, on viability grounds, a reduced level of planning obligations should be provided in respect of a development.

Required by Policy L8 of the Trafford Core Strategy, Policies JP-D1 and JP-D2 of Places for Everyone and the NPPF

In accordance with guidance in NPPF and NPPG and to improve accountability, the Local Planning Authority will make the viability assessment publicly available by publishing it in full on its website alongside other documents that form part of the planning submission. Planning applications will not be validated without a viability assessment, where one is required.

Viability information should be presented in accordance with the guidance in Appendix 2. Where additional clarity is required, during the application process, applicants should expect to provide evidenced justification for specific inputs and outputs underpinning the viability assessment.

Where an exemption from publication is sought for specific inputs, this information should be aggregated in the main viability assessment for publication and a breakdown provided under separate cover with a supporting document providing full justification for the exemption. Whether an exemption is granted will be at the discretion of the Local Planning Authority.

A payment of £6,250 (exclusive of VAT) will be required to cover the Council's costs in assessing the viability information, including the Council's retained viability consultant to analyse and interrogate the contents of the viability assessment and any supporting documentation. Details of the entity to be invoiced and an email address to direct the invoice to should therefore accompany the submission of the planning application. Applicants will be invoiced on validation of the planning application. If the standard build and abnormal costs are deemed to be at a significant level when compared to standard benchmarks and one of the main reasons for a viability challenge for the subject site - the applicant will be required to pay an additional fee to enable the Council to undertake an independent cost plan review. If an unusual level of input is required into the assessment of viability, a further payment may need to be made. Where this is the case, the need for and amount of the payment would be discussed with the applicant in advance of an invoice being raised.

### WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

Threshold - All applications for full planning permission / outline planning permission where approval for layout is sought / reserved matters consent where approval for layout is sought, for residential and non-residential development proposals, including new build development and changes of use, regardless of the size of the proposal.

### APPENDIX 2 TRAFFORD COUNCIL APPLICATION VALIDATION CHECKLIST: JANUARY 2025 GUIDANCE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A VIABILITY APPRAISAL

 Validation Checklist - Approach to Viability in Planning Validation Checklist - Approach to Viability in Planning Validation Checklist - Approach to Viability in Planning 
 
 Viability Methodology Viability Methodology • If an Applicant cannot provide a policy compliant suite of developer contributions, a 'viability case' should be made that will be assessed by the LPA. • The viability methodology must follow the requirements set out in adopted policy and guidancein the NPPF and NPPG on Viability. • The production of appraisals and evidence is wholly the Applicant's responsibility. It is not the LPA's consultant's role to produce evidence and their own appraisal, but to assess the evidence and appraisals produced by the Applicant and decide whether the information provided is robust and evidence based to be able to come to a conclusion on the financial viability of thescheme. • The Applicant should provide a minimum of two appraisals. One which reflects their offer and one which reflects a fully policy compliant scheme. • The viability appraisals should be presented in an industry standard appraisal format summary page with supporting cash flow (Argus Developer Software preferred). • All inputs and assumptions used in the viability appraisal should be evidenced and justified. Stating that it is the industry norm is not a good enoughjustification. 
 Aspirational Return Developer • NPPG ) states: o 'Potential risk is accounted for in the assumed return for developers at the plan making stage. It is the role of developers, not plan makers or decision makers, to mitigate these risks. The cost of fully complying with policy requirements should be accounted for in benchmark land value. Under no circumstances will the price paid for land be relevant justification for failing to accord with relevant policies in the plan.' (para.18). • The aspirational developer return will be part of the developer's proposal. The developer will make their case for the appropriate return, which must reflect Benchmark Land Value and policy compliance. • Due to the reduced risk profile, affordable housing should be at a lower percentage return to the 

 developer. • The developer return applied to different residential tenures and non-residential planning uses will need separate justification. 
 
 Aspirational Land Value  Benchmark  • NPPG is clear in how the Benchmark Land Value (BLV) should be estimated. The BLV needs to reflect all costs, including developer return and policy compliance. For clarity, NPPG does not recommend a methodology of comparison between BLV and Residual Land Value(RLV). • The BLV should be estimated based on NPPG requiredapproach: o 'To define land value for any viability assessment, a benchmark land value should be established on the basis of the existing use value (EUV) of the land, plus a premium for the landowner. The premium for the landowner should reflect the minimum return at which it is considered a reasonable landowner would be willing to sell their land. The premium should provide a reasonable incentive, in comparison with other options available, for the landowner to sell land for development while allowing a sufficient contribution to fully comply with policy requirements.' (para. 13). • NPPG states that the new benchmark land valueshould: o 'be based upon existing use value o allow for a premium to landowners… o reflect the implications of abnormal costs; site-specific infrastructure costs; and professional site fees o …In decision making, the cost implications of all relevant policy requirements, including planning obligations and, where relevant, any Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charge should be taken into account.' (para. 14) • The first component of the BLV is the Existing Use Value. NPPG is clear thatthe: o 'EUV is the value of the land in its existing use. Existing use value is not the price paid and should disregard hope value.' (para. 15). • A premium should not apply when the development site has already been purchased by a developer or land promoted from the landowner land is not subject to change of use. • A premium should not apply when a development site has already been purchased by a developer or land promoter from the landowner. A land promoter is defined as any organisation that intends to dispose of plots of land to a third party to develop out, and will not develop the site themselves. Land promoters should pay a discounted amount for the land they purchase, typically between 15% and 20% discount to Open Market Value, and so do not require an additionalincentive. • NPPG is also clear that 'where viability assessment is used to inform decision making under no circumstances will the price paid for land be a relevant justification for failing to accord with relevant policies in the plan. Local authorities can request data on the price paidfor 

 land (or the price expected to be paid through an option agreement).' (para. 14). • The Applicant should provide the land acquisition price or price expected to be paid through an option as well as purchaser costs including legal fees and agent fees. This should all beevidenced. • Alternative Use Value (AUV) can only be used if it complies with adopted planning policy, there is a strong justification for why the Applicant is not pursuing the alternative use and the alternative use is cable of implementation. NPPG states that no premium should be applied to the AUV. 
  
 GDV - Build to Rent schemes 
 (BTR) • Detailed comparable evidence should be provided with justification for the predicted rents and yields • The transactional data should be comparable with the development in terms of location, quality and age (New-builds). • If there are a lack of new-build comparables, second-hand comparables can be used, though it should be noted that there is a premium in rents and yields with new-builds. • Comparables should include the annual rental value per square foot and date of investmentsale. • All assumptions made when valuing the investment should be listed and justified withevidence. • A Purchaser's cost would usually be expected as a deduction to account for stamp duty (SDLT), Agent Fees and Legal Fees 
 GDV - Sales Values • Detailed comparable evidence should be provided with justification for the predicted salesvalues. • The transactional data should be comparable with the development in terms of type, location, quality and age. • If there are a lack of new-build comparables, second-hand comparables can be used, though it should be noted that there is a premium in sale values with new-builds. • Comparables should include the price per square foot and date of sale/askingprice. • A schedule of unit sizes and estimated sale values should accompany the viabilitycase. • Estate agent estimations are not independent and will not be accepted as evidence, unless they are supported with detailed comparable evidence with a narrative. 
 GDV - Ground Rent We await Government's confirmation on how ground rents will be treated. 

 GDV - Commercial Investment Value • Detailed comparable evidence should be provided with justification for the predicted rents and yields • The transactional data should be comparable with the development in terms of location, qualityand age (New-builds). • If there are a lack of new-build comparables, second-hand comparables can be used, though it should be noted that there is a premium in rents and yields with new-builds. • Comparables should include the annual rental value per square foot and date of investment sale or rent review. • All assumptions made when valuing the investment should be listed and justified withevidence. • A Purchaser's cost would usually be expected as a deduction to account for stamp duty (SDLT), Agent Fees and Legal Fees. 
  
 Affordable Houses • Affordable houses are sold to Registered Providers (RPs) at a discount on Open Market Value (OMV). • Intermediate product should be valued at around 70% OMV. • Affordable Rent should be valued at around 50%OMV. • Social Rent should be valued at around 45% OMV. • Affordable houses typically are transferred to anRP at the point of completion of the dwelling through a golden brick/land and build contract, this should be reflected in the cash flow. We would usually see the affordable houses cash flowed with an upfront land payment (usually around 25% of the affordable housing value) and funding throughout the build contract for the remaining affordable housing value. • As stated in the aspirational return section, the return on the affordable element should be lower than the market element due to these units being pre-sold which results in reducing the risk associated with the product. Areturn of 6%for affordable housing product has been upheld in a number of recent Inspectors' decisions such as B&Q, Trafford (APP/Q5245/W/20/3258552) Warburton Lane, Trafford (APP/Q4245/W/19/3243720) 

 Standard Build Costs • A detailed cost plan should be produced by the Applicant to support their viability case including preliminary costs and overheads and profit referenced as percentages. • Build cost rates should be evidenced and benchmarked by comparable schemes and widely recognised databases such as BCIS. BCIS data needs to be adjusted to reflect the specific circumstances of the project and Applicant. • If the build cost rate is at the upper end of the comparable schemes, detailed justification is required to explain why. 
  
 Abnormals • Abnormal costs are those that the developer perceives to be in addition to 'normal' cost that would be expected to be incurred in the delivery of development. The Abnormal element will be a treatment over and above standard, primarily to deal with difficult groundconditions. • Detailed evidence and justification should be provided as to why the identified abnormal costs are needed including any site investigation reports and detailed cost plans. • NPPG is clear how abnormal costs and site-specific infrastructure costs should be treated when estimating BLVs: ' reflect the implications of abnormal costs; site-specific infrastructure costs; and professional site fees' (para. 14). 
 Cost Plan Review • If the standard build and abnormal costs are deemed to be at a significant level when compared to standard benchmarks and one of the main reasons for a viability challenge for the subject site, the Applicant is required to pay an additional fee to enable the Council to undertake anindependent cost plan review. 
 Finance Cost • A cash flow that was used to substantiate the finance costs, showing spend and revenue received, should be submitted by the Applicant. The Applicant should also state and justify the build period and sale period for thescheme, including the estimated percentage of pre-sales (mainly for apartment schemes). • The Applicant is required to evidence and justify the finance rateused. 

 Professional fees • A detailed list of appointments and fees is required, with supporting evidence. • Professional fees should also be stated as a percentage of total buildcost. 
  
 Sales & Marketing & Legal Fees • Sales, marketing and legal fees should only be applied to the market housing of thescheme. • A breakdown of sales, marketing and legal fees per property should be produced. • Within Trafford we would expect legal fees at around £650 to £750 per property, depending onthe size of the development. 
 Projection Model/Overage Agreements  • If a development cannot fund its planning obligations due to viability, then the LPA will enter into an overage with the developer based on a Projection Model. • NPPG provided guidance on overage agreements: o 'Where contributions are reduced below the requirements set out in policies to provide flexibility in the early stages of a development, there should be a clear agreement of how policy compliance can be achieved over time. As the potential risk to developers is already accounted for in the assumptions for developer return in viability assessment, realisation of risk does not in itself necessitate further viability assessment or trigger a review mechanism. Review mechanisms are not a tool to protect a return to the developer, but to strengthen local authorities' ability to seek compliance with relevant policies over the lifetime of the project.' (para. 9). • A Projection Model will be used to capture the 'super profit' 1 . 
 Approach to Negotiations • NPPG states: o 'In plan making and decision making viability helps to strike a balance between the aspirations of developers and landowners, in terms of returns against risk, and the aims of the planning system to secure maximum benefits in the public interest through the granting of planning permission.' (para. 10). • The above is the basis on which all negotiations will beundertaken. 

1  'Super profit' is any additional value from the sale of houses that generate an outturn that is greater that the predicted Sales Values in the Applicant's viability assessment.

### WHAT DO I NEED TO SUBMIT WITH MY PLANNING APPLICATION?

It is important that your application can demonstrate the site can be sustainably drained; this is a principle of development. This should be demonstrated at the earliest opportunity.

If your development proposal is for major development 1 , or in a Critical Drainage Area, regardless of your type of planning application, you must submit the following with your application for planning permission:

1. Site Specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) Where one is required under the National Planning Policy Framework and  applicable  Local Plan  policies.  In  some  cases, these  also  require  you  to  submit  a Sequential Test and/or Exception Test.
2. Sustainable  Drainage  Strategy  This  will  include  your  overall  approach and  is  where  you  will evidence your approach to surface water management. E.g. plans, drawings, calculations etc. It will also take account of any requirements identified in the FRA.
3. Sustainable Drainage Strategy: Pro-forma The pro-forma summarises and confirms the details contained within your Sustainable Drainage Strategy and Site Specific Flood Risk Assessment. It is intended  to  ensure  all  aspects  of  sustainable  drainage  have  been  considered.  The  information supplied should be appropriate and proportionate to the planning stage, further information can be gained from contacting your Local Planning Authority or Lead Local Flood Authority.

This  document may form part of the Local Planning Authority's 'Planning Validation Checklist.' Planning applications for major development and for sites in Critical Drainage Areas that are not submitted with the above information will not be regarded as a 'valid' application.

This document contains information and guidance about what you need to submit in support of your major planning application.

1 Major development is defined in Section 2 of Statutory Instrument 2015 No. 595.

### COMPLETING YOUR SUSTAINABLE DRAINAGE STRATEGY AND SUDS PRO-FORMA

## What is a Sustainable Drainage Strategy?

The purpose of a Sustainable Drainage Strategy is to set out how surface water from a development site will be managed sustainably under both current and future conditions, and to support your proposed approach with appropriate evidence, such as drainage calculations and relevant plans and drawings.

The Sustainable Drainage Strategy must also set out how all sustainable drainage components are intended to be managed and maintained over the lifetime of the development to ensure that the sustainable drainage system will continue to perform throughout its design life.

## How is  a  Sustainable  Drainage  Strategy  different  to  a  Site-Specific  Flood  Risk Assessment (FRA)?

A Site-Specific FRA assesses all sources of flood risk to and from the site and elsewhere, as a result of the development.

A Sustainable Drainage Strategy demonstrates how surface water from the development will be managed in line  with  national  and  local  requirements  for  sustainable  drainage  systems  and  should  incorporate  the findings and address risks identified in the site specific FRA.

## What is the purpose of the Pro-forma?

The pro-forma will support your planning application by ensuring that your sustainable drainage design, contained  within  your  Sustainable  Drainage  Strategy,  has  considered  and  appropriately  evidenced everything it needs to, reducing the risk of delays or refusal of your application as a result of a lack of information about sustainable drainage proposals.

## What if I don't submit the pro-forma with my application?

The pro-forma may be a requirement of the planning validation checklist in the Local Planning Authority area  your  development  proposal  is  in. This  means  if  you  do  not  submit  a  completed  pro-forma  your application will not be 'valid' and therefore will not be processed by the Local Planning Authority until a completed SuDS pro-forma has been received.

Where this pro-forma is not a requirement of the planning validation checklist it is strongly advised that a completed  pro-forma  is  submitted  as  this  will  help  to  ensure  that  the  minimum  required  information regarding your drainage proposals has been provided.

## How do I complete the pro-forma?

You must fill  in  all  white  boxes  in  the  pro-forma  for  the  document  to  be  accepted  as  complete .  This guidance note will support you in completing the pro-forma.

### FURTHER HELP AND ADVICE

It is advised that you employ an appropriately qualified drainage engineer to design all aspects of your site drainage, including taking account of in perpetuity maintenance of the system.

We would also encourage your drainage engineer to work with the landscape architect for the site.

## Online tools and information

The UK SuDS and Susdrain websites are helpful in answering common questions on sustainable drainage design and also provide a range of tools, guidance and examples.

UK  Sustainable  Drainage  Guidance  &amp;  Tools  website ,  supported  by  HR  Wallingford  Ltd,  provides  a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

The pro-forma can be completed using freely available tools such as Tools for Sustainable Drainage Systems or appropriate Industry Standard surface water management design software.

## Pre-application service

Many Local Authorities offer a 'pre-application' service which enables applicants to obtain guidance and feedback from planning and other specialist officers before submitting their planning application, including from the Lead Local Flood Authority.

This service provides an opportunity for applicants to identify and discuss potential issues before submitting planning applications reducing the risk of applications being refused or delayed.  There may be a charge for this service.

### SECTION 1. APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT DETAILS

## What is meant by 'Drained Area' of Development'?

Any  area  that  may  contribute  to  flows  within  the  proposed  drainage  system.  They  may  be  either  from permeable or impermeable areas and can also include areas from outside the proposed development area.

## Do I need to submit a Site-Specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)?

Under Footnote 50 of Paragraph 163 of the National Planning Policy Framework a  Site-Specific  FRA  is required if your development is:

- in Flood Zones 2 and 3 (this applies to all development types)
- in Flood Zone 1, for proposals involving: sites of 1 hectare or more
- on land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as having critical drainage problems
- on land identified in a strategic flood risk assessment as being at increased flood risk in future
- on land that may be subject to other sources of flooding, where its development would introduce a more vulnerable use

If your development proposal meets any of these criteria, there are no exemptions to a Site-Specific FRA and you must submit one in order for your planning application to be validated by the Local Planning Authority.

## What information does my Flood Risk Assessment need to include?

The  information  your  Site-Specific  FRA  needs  to  include  is  contained  within 'Flood  risk  assessment  for planning applications' and the Planning Practice Guidance.

Reference should also be made to the Local Planning Authority's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment for locally specific guidance and information.

The detail and technical complexity of any Site-Specific FRA will reflect the scale, nature and location of your development proposal.

## What if I am unable to complete a Site-Specific Flood Risk Assessment?

It is recommended that someone appropriately qualified is employed to undertake an FRA. If you meet the requirements for a Site-Specific FRA and you must submit one for your planning application to be validated by the Local Planning Authority.

## How do I work out the expected lifetime of the development?

The Planning Practice Guidance states all residential developments have an expected minimum lifetime of 100 years, unless there is specific justification for considering a shorter period.

For non-residential development, you need to specify how long you expect the development to last taking account of the advice given in the Planning Practice Guidance.

## Development Type - What is classified as 'Greenfield' and 'Previously Developed'?

It is important that you are clear on the difference between 'Greenfield' and 'Previously Developed' sites in the context of drainage - not planning - and therefore the surface water drainage design standard expected for your development site.

## Previously Developed / Brownfield

If  you  are  proposing  to  use  an  existing  drainage  system  for  surface  water  management  on  your development site, your drainage system can be designed to 'previously developed' standards. For sites covered by buildings or impermeable hard surfaces this may require a reduction to existing rates to  be  applied  in  order  to  satisfy  local  planning  policies  -  please  check  with  your  Local  Planning Authority (LPA).

For the avoidance of doubt, 'use of an existing drainage system' means utilising the entirety of the existing drainage system on site and does not refer to simply the point of discharge.

- Example: If  you  are  proposing to  demolish  an  existing  building  and replace  it  with  a new building but will use the existing means of surface water removal in entirety, this would be classified as 'previously developed.'

## Greenfield

If  you  are  proposing  to  install  a  new  drainage  system  for  surface  water  management  on  your development site then your drainage system must be designed to 'greenfield' standards, even if the land has been previously developed. It may be worth checking your Local Planning Authority's Local Plan for a local policy position.

- Example 1: If  you are proposing to construct buildings on land which has been previously developed (i.e. brownfield) but are installing a new surface water drainage system connecting to the existing outfall, this would be classified as 'greenfield.'
- Example 2: If  you  are  proposing to construct buildings on unbuilt 'green' land and will be installing a new surface water drainage system connecting to a new or existing outfall, this would be classified as 'greenfield.'

### SECTION 2: I MPERMEABLE AREA AND EXISTING DRAINAGE

## How do I work out the impermeable area?

Anything that has, or will have, impermeable surfaces within the curtilage of your development site must be included here. This includes impermeable roads, footpaths and buildings.

## What should be considered as existing flow routes and flood risks?

Any flows that will enter and cross the development site. The catchment area above the site should also be considered and details of how these existing flow routes will be managed through the site so that flooding is not increased either within or outside the site.

## Do I need to consider flows coming onto the site?

Yes, any flows that are likely to flow onto the site need to be considered as part of the planning submission. Details on how the flows enter the site and how they will be managed once the development is complete should be included.

For example, surface water from adjacent land may run overland across the development site. You must assess how best to deal with this runoff and ensure you do not block its path with the new development. You may need to mitigate against this potential flood risk by creating a flow path through the site or diverting the flow around the site

## What areas should be considered for the contributing areas in hydraulic models?

Any areas flowing into the drainage system should be considered as part of the contributing areas. These can  be  either  permeable  or  impermeable  areas.  You  should  consider  how  you  will  achieve  this  if  your software package only assumes runoff from impermeable areas.

### SECTION 3: PEAK RUNOFF RATES

## Why is this information required?

Defra's Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems require peak runoff rates from development sites to be restricted in line with Technical Standards S2, S3 and S6, unless S1 applies.

## What is the 'peak runoff rate'?

This is the maximum flow rate at which surface water runoff leaves the site during the critical storm event.

## How do I calculate Existing Runoff Rates from Previously Developed / Brownfield sites?

The available methods of calculating runoff rates from previously developed sites are outline in Chapter 24.5 of The SuDS Manual ( C753). Discuss with the LLFA if you are unsure.

## How do I calculate Greenfield Runoff Rates?

The available methods of calculating Greenfield runoff rates are outline in Chapter 24.3 of The SuDS Manual ( C753) . Discuss with the LLFA if you are unsure.

## What  about  watercourses  discharging  to  estuarial  waters  that  are  tidally affected?

Where the drainage system discharges to a surface water body that can accommodate uncontrolled surface water discharges without any impact on flood risk from that surface water body (e.g. the sea or a large estuary) the peak flow control standards and volume control technical standards need not apply.

Confirm with your LLFA prior to planning application submission.

## Which methodologies should be used to calculate discharge rates?

Methodologies listed in Chapter 24 of The SuDS Manual ( C753) are considered appropriate.

## What values do I use for Qbar?

Qbar is the peak rate of flow from a catchment for the mean annual flood, a return period of approximately 1:2.3 years. Qbarrural should be used for this value.

## What must I limit proposed post-development surface water discharge rates to?

That depends on the approach you take to limiting the amount of surface water discharged from the site.

Approach  1  (Long  Term  Storage) controls  discharge  rate  and  discharge  volume  by  providing  long-term storage,  allowing  an  attenuated  volume  equivalent  to  the  1:100  year  6  hour  greenfield  event  to  be discharged at the greenfield 1:100 year rate for the 1 in 100 year 6 hour event (plus an allowance for climate change).  Additional post-development runoff volume should be infiltrated into the ground or released at a rate no greater than 2 l/s/ha.

Therefore,  in accordance with Standard S2 and S3 of Defra's Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems the following discharge rates from the development to any highway drain, sewer or surface water body must be achieved:

Greenfield Site: For  greenfield developments, the peak runoff rate from the development to any highway drain, sewer or surface water body for the 1 in 1 year rainfall event and the 1 in 100 year rainfall event should never exceed the peak greenfield runoff rate for the same event.

## Previously Developed Site:

For developments which were previously developed, the peak runoff rate from the development to any drain, sewer or surface water body for the 1 in 1 year rainfall event and the 1 in 100 year rainfall event must be as close as reasonably practicable to the greenfield runoff rate from the development for the same rainfall event, but should never exceed the rate of discharge from the development prior to redevelopment for that event.

Approach 1 is the preferred approach but is only appropriate when the volume of surface water discharged from the site for the 1 in 100 (plus climate change) 6 hour event is limited to the greenfield equivalent.  This is achieved through the use of long-term storage (if the actual greenfield volume cannot be achieved) which will either be infiltrated into the ground or released at a rate no greater than 2 l/s/ha.

Approach  2  (Attenuation  Only) provides  an  alternative  where  the  greenfield  runoff  volume  cannot  be achieved/it can be demonstrated that long term storage is unachievable.  In accordance with S6 of Defra's Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems, which requires runoff volume to be discharged at a rate that does not adversely affect flood risk, rainfall events up to and including the 1:100 year (plus climate change) event should be attenuated and released at the greenfield Qbar rate.

For more information you can refer to the following:

- Chapter 3.3 of The SuDS Manual ( C753)
- Rainfall runoff management for developments (Environment Agency)
- Assessing attenuation storage volumes for SuDS (CIRIA)

To mitigate for climate change the proposed 1 in 100 year (plus climate change allowance) rainfall event must be no greater than the existing 1 in 100 year rainfall event runoff rate. If this cannot be achieved, surface water flood risk increases under climate change.

To avoid delays or refusal it is advisable to confirm with your LLFA that your proposed discharge rate is acceptable prior to submission if the rate of discharge is higher than the greenfield equivalent.  The proposed rate  must  be  justified  and  appropriately  evidenced  as  there  is  a  presumption  that  greenfield  rates  are achievable for the majority of sites.

## What volumetric and routing coefficients should I use?

You should not assume software package default values will be acceptable - you must be able to justify the parameters you have used.  Refer to Chapter 24 of The SuDS Manual ( C753) for more information

## How can I restrict flow rates?

It is recommended that you refer to The SuDS Manual ( C753) for options of how to restrict your flow rate(s), essentially the options available are:

- vortex control systems
- inlets, outlets and flow control systems

### SECTION 4: DISCHARGE VOLUME

## What is 'discharge volume' and why must I consider it?

Discharge volume is the total volume of water leaving the development site for a particular rainfall event.

Introducing new impermeable surfaces increases surface water runoff and therefore can increase flood risk within  and  outside  the  development.  By  understanding  the  increase  in  surface  water  runoff  volume measures can be taken to attenuate flows and mitigate any potential flood risk outside of the development.

Defra's Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems require runoff volume from development sites to be restricted in line with Technical Standards S4, S5 and/or S6, unless S1 applies.

## What  must  proposed  post-development  surface  water  discharge  volume  be limited to?

In  line  with  Standard  S4  and  S5  of Defra's  Technical  Standards  for  Sustainable  Drainage  Systems the following discharge volumes from the development to any highway drain, sewer or surface water body must be achieved:

Greenfield  Site: For  greenfield  development,  the  runoff  volume  from  the  development  to  any highway drain, sewer or surface water body in the 1 in 100 year, 6 hour rainfall event should never exceed the greenfield runoff volume for the same event.

Previously Developed Site: For  developments which have been previously developed, the runoff volume from the development to any highway drain, sewer or surface water body in the 1 in 100 year, 6 hour rainfall event must be constrained to a value as close as is reasonably practicable to the greenfield runoff volume for the same event, but should never exceed the runoff volume from the development site prior to redevelopment for that event.

Where it is not reasonably practicable to constrain the volume of runoff to any drain, sewer or surface water body in accordance with the above, the runoff volume must be discharged at a rate that does not adversely affect flood risk (usually Qbar). Discuss with your LLFA pre-application if this is not achievable.

## Why do I need to calculate the runoff volume for the 100 year 6 hour storm event?

This  is  a  simple  method  of  calculating  the  volume  of  surface  water  discharging  from  a  development  site  to determine whether there will be an increase in runoff volume discharging to the downstream catchment and subsequently whether there will be an increase in flood risk

By using a single specific storm event such as the 100 year 6 hour storm event, we are able to compare the volumetric runoff response from the existing site and the developed site.

The greenfield runoff  volume  generated  by  the  100  year  6  hour  storm  is  the  maximum  volume  that  can  be attenuated and discharged at the 1:100 year greenfield discharge rate.  Additional volume generated as a result

of development for the 1:100 (plus climate change event) 6 hour storm should utilise long-term storage and either infiltrate into the ground or discharge at a rate of 2 l/s/ha.

For more information, refer to the FAQ section on uksuds.com.

## How  can  I  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  post-development  surface  water discharge volume has taken account of climate change?

To mitigate for climate change, the volume discharge from site during the 1:100 year + climate change event should be no greater than the greenfield 1 in 100 year event.

The appropriate climate change allowance must be applied. See guidance under Section 5 for what climate change allowance you need to apply.

### SECTION 5: STORAGE

## Why is this information required?

Defra's Technical Standards for SuDS requires flood risk within the development to be considered and the sustainable drainage system designed to ensure flooding doesn't occur on-site or elsewhere during certain rainfall events in line with Technical Standards S7, S8 and S9.

## How can I provide storage for surface water?

To slowly release surface water at a restricted (attenuated) rate you will need to provide storage where excess flows can be held.

Paragraph  165  of  the National  Planning  Policy  Framework encourages  multifunctional  benefits  of sustainable drainage systems and opportunities to achieve this are encouraged, for example through the use of detention basins, ponds, wetlands and swales.

It can be more cost effective to store volumes of water across a site in sub-catchments as part of the SuDS management train rather than storing at one location prior to discharge ( Assessing attenuation storage volumes for SuDS, CIRIA fact sheet ).

Please note that regardless of the approach used, it is important to run a range of duration events to ensure the worst case condition is found for each drainage element on the site.

## What climate change allowance do I need to provide?

The capacity of SuDS must provide effective drainage for the development, taking account of the likely impacts of climate change and the likely changes in impermeable area within the site over the lifetime of the development.

New climate change allowances were published on 10 May 2022. You will need to ensure you incorporate the new allowances into your flood risk assessment and sustainable drainage design.

When determining what climate change allowance to apply, two variables must be considered:

## 1. Location and size of the drainage catchment

- o Urban/Small (flashy) Catchments: Use the peak rainfall allowances  map for small catchments (less than 5 sq km), or urbanised drainage catchments. A drainage catchment is urban if the land use is a town or city.
- o Rural/Large  Catchments: For  large  rural  drainage  catchments  use  the peak  river  flow allowances.

## 2. Lifetime of the development

- o For all residential development, the development lifetime is 100 years.

- o For all other development types, a 100-year lifetime is to be applied unless the development has a time limited planning condition OR a shorter development lifetime is agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.

For flood risk assessments and strategic flood risk assessments the upper end allowance must be assessed for both the 1% and 3.3% annual exceedance probability events for the 2070s epoch (2061 to 2125).

Discuss with the Lead Local Flood Authority if you are unsure what climate change allowance to apply.

## What rates should I use for Urban Creep?

Urban  creep  is  the  conversion  of  permeable  surfaces  to  impermeable  over  time  e.g.  surfacing  of  front gardens to provide additional parking spaces, extensions to existing buildings, creation of large patio areas.

The appropriate allowance for urban creep should be included in the design of the drainage system over the lifetime of the proposed development.

In accordance with Section 24.7.2 of The SuDS Manual ( C753) and Section 8.3 of BS 8582:2013 Code of practice for surface water management for development sites , to allow for future urban expansion within the development an increase in paved surface area of 10% is to be applied if there is no specified value stipulated by the Lead Local Flood Authority or Local Planning Authority.

### SECTION 6: WATER QUALITY PROTECTION

## Why do I need to consider water quality in my proposal?

All surface water runoff is, to some degree, contaminated. You are asked to identify the pollution hazard level associated with the proposed development. This is the first stage in identifying an appropriate surface water SuDS treatment train as part of your drainage design to consider the risks of pollution to controlled waters.

This information is required to satisfy Paragraph 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework and is therefore necessary to consider before a surface water drainage strategy can be agreed.

## Why do I need to consider if the ground is contaminated?

The  previous  use  of  the  site  will  also  influence  the  type  of  sustainable  drainage  system  proposed.  For example, if the ground is contaminated the use of infiltration would not be appropriate.

This is acknowledged within Section 7b of the pro-forma as a reason why infiltration has been discounted ' Evidence to confirm that infiltration to ground would result in a risk of deterioration to ground water quality' .

## How can I demonstrate that I have considered water quality?

You can take measures to reduce contamination and therefore negative impacts on the water quality of receiving water bodies by including an appropriate treatment train as part of your sustainable drainage system in accordance with The SuDS Manual ( C753).

The level of treatment required in the surface water drainage system will be dependent on the nature and scale of the proposed development. This is called the 'pollution hazard level' and once this is known The SuDS Manual ( C753) provides  detailed  technical  guidance  on  how  to  quantify  which  SuDS  features  will provide an appropriate level of treatment for a given land use.

## What if my development poses a medium or high pollution hazard level?

For all high pollution hazard level developments, a more detailed assessment of the pollution risks from surface waters will be required as an appropriate surface water SuDS treatment train cannot be established without it. This information will be required before a surface water drainage strategy can be agreed.

For  some medium pollution hazard level developments, further detailed assessment will be required to consider  the  risks  of  pollution  to  controlled  waters  and  determine  what  SuDS  features  would  be  most appropriate. This information will be required before a surface water drainage strategy can be agreed.

Developments with a High and / or Medium pollution hazard potential may also require an Environmental Permit  from  the  Environment  Agency. For  proposals  of  this  nature,  it  is  advisable  to  undertake  preapplication discussions with the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency charge for providing detailed planning guidance through their discretionary advice service.  More information is available here .

On  contaminated  sites,  sufficient  information  should  be  submitted  to  demonstrate  that  the  SuDS components proposed will not increase the risk of pollution to controlled waters through the mobilisation of contaminants and/or the creation of new pollution pathways.

## What if my development poses a low pollution hazard level?

For low pollution hazard level developments, you should incorporate an appropriate surface water SuDS treatment train into the design of your sustainable drainage system. The SuDS Manual ( C753) provides detailed technical guidance on how to quantify which SuDS features will provide an appropriate level of treatment for your given land use.

### SECTION 7: DETAILS OF YOUR SUSTAINABLE DRAINAGE SYSTEM

## Functions of your Sustainable Drainage System

Development  often  alters  natural  drainage  by  replacing  free  draining  and/or  vegetated  ground  with impermeable surfaces, gullies, pipes and channels. These changes result in an increase in the total volume and flow of runoff from a site.

For this reason, it is encouraged for applicants to consider how they can first utilise rainwater as a resource within  their  proposals,  and  to  promote  source  control  (managing  rainfall  close  to  where  it  falls)  which promotes natural losses through soakage, infiltration and evapotranspiration.

This will help to reduce discharges of surface water from site in the smaller rainfall events, helping to retain it onsite similar to the pre-developed condition.

## What is the SuDS Hierarchy?

The hierarchy of drainage options is outlined in the Planning Practice Guidance .

Generally, the aim should be to discharge surface run off as high up the following hierarchy of drainage options as reasonably practicable.

This is outlined as follows, in order of priority:

1. into the ground (infiltration);
2. to a surface waterbody;
3. to a surface water sewer or highway drain;
4. to a combined sewer.

Applicants must submit robust justification and appropriate evidence, to demonstrate how each level has been discounted. The evidence required at each stage of the hierarchy is specified in the 'Evidence Required' column of the pro-forma.

## When can infiltration be used in drainage design?

Infiltration allows surface water runoff to infiltrate into the ground and should be used wherever possible. Infiltration is encouraged to be used alongside and in addition to other SuDS techniques, for example, to deliver interception for the upstream hardstanding areas, and can help reduce the amount of attenuation required for a site and replicate greenfield conditions for frequent rainfall events. Where ground conditions allow, discharge to ground via infiltration can be used as the effective outfall for surface water disposal (as per the above hierarchy).

Maximising infiltration, for example through source control measures, reduces the volume of runoff and can therefore reduce the volume of attenuation you need to provide as part of your sustainable drainage system.

Infiltration can also:

- be effective at pollutant removal via filtering through the soils
- be simple and cost-effective to construct and maintain

## Why do I need to submit a 'Plan B' sustainable drainage design?

For proposals, particularly outline applications, where the effective outfall is to ground (via infiltration) the applicant  should  consider  an  alternative  'Plan  B'  sustainable  drainage  design  utilising  an  alternative discharge  method,  for  the  event  that  infiltration  proposals  are  not  feasible  upon  site  specific  ground investigation.

## What  minimum  evidence  do  I  need  to  provide  in  this  section  for  an  outline application?

For both your Plan A and Plan B SuDS designs, the minimum information you should provide is a desktop study of the ground conditions on your development site.

If you have also undertaken ground investigations e.g. a geotechnical survey and/or infiltration testing you should also submit these in support of your application, in accordance with the 'evidence checklist'.

## Where can I find information on indicative ground conditions?

British  Geological  Survey  offers  a  'SuDS  Infiltration  Map'  service  which  will  provide  a  comprehensive indication  on  whether  infiltration  will  be  feasible  on  your  development  site.  This  information  can  be submitted in support of your application and will support you in designing your sustainable drainage system:

## https://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/hydrogeology/infiltrationSuds.html

Your Local Planning Authority may also have more local information on ground conditions in the area.

## What level of detail do I need to provide in my Plan B SuDS design?

As this is an alternative SuDS design, the design should be based on assumptions that key variables (e.g. ground conditions) of your 'Plan A' design are unfeasible and provide:

- a description of how and where you intend to store and discharge surface water.
- a map showing where you intend to store and discharge surface water.

NOTE: The  volume  of  storage  and  rate  of  surface  water  discharge  for  your  Plan  B  design  will  remain unchanged.

## What is a Watercourse Survey Report?

This survey and report details the condition of the watercourse to which the site drains including crosssections of any adjacent watercourses for appropriate distance upstream and downstream of the discharge point (as agreed with the Lead Local Flood Authority and/or Environment Agency).

In cases of culverted watercourses a CCTV survey may be required to demonstrate its structural condition.

## Under what circumstances will I need watercourse permission?

If your development proposals are within 8 metres of the top of the banks of a watercourse (16 metres of a main river if it involves quarrying or excavation or if it is a tidal main river) or make changes to a watercourse, you may need a Consent or Permit in addition to planning permission.

The requirement for a Consent or Permit is separate to and independent of any planning permission given by the Local Planning Authority. This means that the grant of planning permission does not guarantee that Consent or a Permit will be given.

## What type of watercourse permission do I need and how do I apply?

Watercourses have two  classifications  -  'ordinary'  and  'main  river'  -  and  this  determines  what  type  of permission you require.

- Main Rivers are watercourses which have been designated as a 'Main River' on the Environment Agency's 'Main River' map. Works near to or on these watercourses may require a Permit from the Environment Agency.
- Ordinary Watercourses are watercourses which have not been designated as a 'Main River' on the Environment Agency's 'Main River' map. Works to these watercourses require consent from the LLFA.

You can identify whether a watercourse is classified as a 'main river' or 'ordinary watercourse', by viewing the Environment Agency's 'Main River Map' .

## When do I need to apply for watercourse permission?

It is strongly advised that you obtain any required Consent or Permit before or concurrently as you apply for planning permission to avoid delays. This is supported by Paragraph 42 of the National Planning Policy Framework which encourages parallel processing of other required consents.

You must obtain your Consent or Permit before undertaking any work on site. You are breaking the law if you  carry  out  activity  without  one  and  may  be  subject  to  enforcement  action  if  you  do  not  obtain  the necessary permission.

## How  can  I  obtain  agreement  to  discharge  to  the  sewer  from  the  Water  and Sewerage Company?

You must have written approval from the Water and Sewerage Company before you can connect to a public sewer.

United Utilities will advise a maximum rate of discharge. However, the final discharge rate is to be agreed with the Lead Local Flood Authority and is unlikely to be greater than greenfield runoff rates. Any discharge to the public sewer is on the condition that the other options, as outlined within the surface water hierarchy of discharge options (in order of priority) have been discounted.

## Proposed SuDS component types

In this section, the applicant should identify the SuDS components proposed as part of their sustainable drainage system design that are:

- Within the property boundary
- Within the development site boundary
- Not within the boundary of the proposed development (off site).

Susdrain website provides a useful overview of different SuDS components.

## What if part of the proposed SuDS is outside the curtilage of the development site?

If any part of your proposed sustainable drainage system is outside of the curtilage of the development site AND the  applicant  owns  the  land,  you  must  submit  a  plan  showing  the  amended  curtilage  of  the development site to the Local Planning Authority.

If your point of discharge for your sustainable drainage system is through/via land that is NOT owned by the applicant, you must secure an appropriate legal agreement with the land owner for construction works, access, ownership and in perpetuity maintenance of the asset. Evidence of this must be supplied to the LLFA.

## When would I need a Third Party Landowner Agreement?

If  you  are  constructing any  part  of  your  sustainable drainage  system on land that is NOT owned by the applicant i.e. 'off site' as indicated in Section 7c of the pro-forma.

You must secure an appropriate agreement with the landowner for construction works, access, ownership and in perpetuity maintenance of the asset. Evidence that this has been secured must be provided before the approval of your final confirmed sustainable drainage design.

## What are the 'types' of pervious pavements?

You can find details of this in Chapter 20 of The SuDS Manual C753 .

## Where can I find guidance on designing for exceedance?

CIRIA Designing for exceedance in urban drainage - good practice (C635).

### SECTION 8: OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

## Why  do  I  need  to  consider  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  sustainable drainage system?

Operation and maintenance of the SuDS system should be considered at an early stage. The Designer has an obligation to design for maintenance under The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015.

Paragraph 165 of the National Planning Policy Framework requires maintenance arrangements to be put in place to ensure an acceptable standard of operation for the lifetime of the development.

Sustainable  Drainage  Systems:  Written  Statement  -  HCWS161 states  that 'in  considering  planning applications,  local  planning  authorities  should  consult  the  relevant  lead  local  flood  authority  on  the management of surface water; satisfy themselves that the proposed minimum standards of operation are appropriate and ensure through the use of planning conditions or planning obligations that there are clear arrangements in place for ongoing maintenance over the lifetime of the development'.

## Defra's Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems state:

S10 Components must be designed to ensure structural integrity of the drainage system and any adjacent structures or infrastructure under anticipated loading conditions over the design life of the development taking into account the requirement for reasonable levels of maintenance.

S11 The materials, including products, components, fittings or naturally occurring materials, which are specified by the designer must be of a suitable nature and quality for their intended use.

## What do I need to provide to demonstrate maintenance arrangements are or can be put in place?

Applicants must provide the information listed within the 'Evidence Required' columns of the pro-forma to demonstrate to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) that clear arrangements will be in place for on-going management and maintenance over the lifetime of the development.

## What are the maintenance options for sustainable drainage systems?

There are a range of viable maintenance options for the ownership and adoption of sustainable drainage systems,  therefore  the  applicant  should  clearly  state  their  proposed  maintenance  and  management arrangements.

The applicant should identify any of the adopting bodies that you will be offering your sustainable drainage components for adoption.

## What about SuDS components that are within a property boundary (e.g. roof garden)?

The  applicant  may  be  required  to  enter  into  a  Section  106  agreement  prior  to  the  grant  of  planning permission, requiring that any sustainable drainage components on private property (e.g. individual houses) are maintained in perpetuity by the landowner enforced by a Deed of Grant and applied to the freehold title.

For any SuDS components proposed within the curtilage of a private property (e.g. individual houses) the developer should clearly set out any maintenance responsibilities for those SuDS components and potential implications of non-maintenance, and ensure this is communicated to the purchaser of such properties.

Developers are encouraged to provide details of SuDS components on the development site, both communal and private (property level), for inclusion within the Home Information Pack.

## GLOSSARY

 Combined Sewer A sewer that drains both rainwater and foul water. 
  
 Curtilage Land area within property boundaries 
 Culvert A covered structure under a road, embankment etc, to direct the flow of water. 
 Evapotranspiration The process by which the Earth's surface or soil loses moisture by evaporation of water and by uptake and then transpiration from plants. 
 Exceedance design Designing a system to manage effectively events that exceed (i.e. are bigger and rarer than) the drainage system's required level of service. 
 Exceedance event A rainfall or flow event that exceeds (i.e. is bigger and rarer than) the design event, not to be confused with an extreme event. 
 Exceedance flows Flows in excess of those for which a system is designed 
 Four pillars of SuDS  The types of benefits that can be achieved by SuDS will be dependent on the site, but fit broadly into four categories: water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity. These are also referred to as the four pillars of SuDS design. 
 Flood routing Design and consideration of above-ground areas that act as pathways permitting water to run safely overland to minimise the adverse effect of flooding. This is required when the design capacity of the drainage system has been exceeded 
 Geohazard A geologic hazard. In the case SuDS, this is particularly relevant for infiltration. See Chapter 25.2.3 of The SuDS Manual ( C753) for more information. 
 Greenfield runoff The surface water runoff regime from a site before development. 
 Home-zone As a residential street where people and vehicles share the whole of the street space safely, and on equal terms, where quality of life takes precedence over the ease of traffic movement. 
 Infiltration The passage of surface water though the surface of the ground / the entry of groundwater to a sewer. 
 Interception The capture and retention on site of the first 5mm(or other specified depth) of the majority of all rainfall events 
 Management train The sequence of drainage components that collect, convey, store and treat runoff as it drains through the site. 

 Modified flow routes Ordinary Watercourse Flow routes that have been modified as a result of the development. Any watercourse that does not form part of a main river and is not classified as a main river. 
  
 Peak flow The point at which the flow of water from a given event is at its highest. 
 Riparian landowner A riparian landowner is the owner of land that is next to a watercourse or has a watercourse running through or beneath it. Riparian landowners have discrete legal rights and responsibilities in relation to the watercourse and its banks. 
 Source control The control of runoff at or near its source, so that it does not enter the drainage system or is delayed and attenuated before it enters the drainage system. 
 SuDS component An individual element of the drainage system that conveys, stores and/or treats surface water runoff. Susdrain website provides an overview of different SuDS components. 
 Treatment Improving the quality of water by physical, chemical or biological means 
 Treatment train Improving the quality of water by physical, chemical or biological means via a sequence of drainage components (see management train). 
 Urban creep The increasing density of development, due to extensions, paving over of gardens and other permeable areas, and the addition or extension of roads or buildings, which increases the impermeability of developed areas and causes rates and volumes of runoff to rise.
