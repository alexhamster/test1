Text: A Introduction 1. Purpose

Text: A Introduction In July 2021 Arca was commissioned to prepare a planning application for a new gate to close the communal alleyway serving Nos 72-78 The Downs, and opening onto New Street in Altrincham (‘the Site’). The purpose of this statement is to satisfy the requirements of Trafford MBC for a Heritage Statement to accompany a planning application in a Conservation Area.

Text: A Introduction 2. General Methodology - Focus on Proportionality

Text: A Introduction 2.1. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2019 states that “the level of detail should be proportionate to the

Text: A Introduction assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance” (NPPF, para 128).

Text: A Introduction 2.2. Given the very small scale of the proposals this Heritage Statement is kept concise

Text: A Introduction 3. Research Methodology

Text: A Introduction 3.1. This document has been informed by inspection of historic maps, and study of character of the local context.

Text: B Policy Context B Policy Context

Text: B Policy Context 1.

Text: B Policy Context The key planning policy documents are respectively, the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2019, and associated local and national conservation area guidance. The relevance of the policy framework to the development of the Site is discussed below.

Text: B Policy Context The Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990

Text: B Policy Context 2.1. Section 7 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Area) Act 1990 states that “any works for the demolition of a listed building or for its alteration or extension in any manner which would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest” require authorisation in the form of Listed Building Consent.

Text: B Policy Context 2.2. Historic England guidance states that “Local planning authorities are obliged to designate as conservation areas any parts of their own area that are of special architectural or historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance … Conservation area designation introduces a general control over the demolition of unlisted buildings and provides a basis for planning policies whose objective is to conserve all aspects of character or appearance, including landscape and public spaces, that define an area’s special interest.”

Text: B Policy Context 2.3. The emphasis placed on the developer is therefore that of conserving or enhancing the character of Trafford MBC’s designated Downs Conservation Area.

Text: B Policy Context 3. National Planning Policy Framework (2019)

Text: B Policy Context 3.2. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF, 2019) sets out the framework for both plan-making and decision- taking to ensure that heritage assets are conserved, and where appropriate enhanced in a manner that is consistent with their significance and thereby achieving sustainable development.

Text: B Policy Context 3.3. Paragraph 189 of the NPPF states that applicants are required to, “describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting.” Section 3 of the Planning Policy Guidance: Conserving

Text: Arca and Enhancing the Historic Environment (Paragraph: 009 ID: 18a-009-20140306) furthers this requirement by stressing that; “Heritage Assets may be affected by direct physical change, or by change in their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent and importance of the significance of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, is very important to understanding the potential impact and acceptability of development proposals”.

Text: Arca 3.4. This document describes the quality and character of the heritage asset, and the general context of the

Text: Arca Conservation Area.

Text: Arca 4. Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) (2014 and as subsequently amended)

Text: Arca 4.1. Of relevance in this instance is Paragraph 13 which aims to define setting as a term and to explain how it should be

Text: Arca taken into account in the assessment of proposals. Paragraph 13 defines the setting of a heritage asset as “...the surroundings in which an asset is experienced [which] may therefore be more extensive than its curtilage. All heritage assets have a setting, irrespective of the form in which they survive...”.

Text: Arca 4.2. Again this document describes the context for the new gate.

Text: Arca 5. Local Planning Policy

Text: Arca 5.1. Trafford MBC have published their draft Local Plan for consultation in January 2021. While all the HE prefix paragraphs have relevance, the most pertinent policies are set out below.

Text: Arca 5.2. HE1.1 “Development shall be designed to preserve and where possible enhance the significance of heritage assets

Text: Arca and their settings, and make a positive contribution to local character, distinctiveness and sense of place.

Text: Arca 5.3. HE1.2 “The Council will encourage development proposals that find appropriate new and sustainable uses for

Text: Arca heritage assets or retain them in viable uses consistent with their conservation.”

Text: Arca 5.4. HE1.3 “Any development that would cause harm to the significance of a heritage asset or its setting will be considered in accordance with the development plan and national policy, and where relevant the statutory duties in the Planning Acts together with case law. It must be convincingly demonstrated that the harm cannot reasonably be avoided and public benefits arising from the development are sufficient to outweigh the harm caused.”

Text: Arca 5.5. HE2.1 “Trafford’s Conservation Areas are identified on the policies map. Within these areas the Council will:

Text: Arca - a) Review Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans, and update where necessary;

Text: Arca - b) Require, where development involves alteration or demolition, that it takes account of the relative significance

Text: Arca of the building, structure or site affected, and the contribution it makes to the significance of the Conservation Area as a whole, including the public benefits of the proposal;

Text: Arca - c) Seek the retention and re-use of existing buildings and structures;

Text: Arca - d) Require, where development is to follow demolition, that detailed planning permission for the proposed

Text: Arca redevelopment shall be obtained and the implementation of that proposal secured before the existing building or structure is demolished ;

Text: Arca - e) Require developers to demonstrate how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the significance of

Text: Arca buildings, structures and/or sites and of The Trafford Local Plan - Consultation Draft - January 2021 111 the wider Conservation Area, and their setting taking account of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents, and

Text: Arca - f) Serve Article 4 directions where required.”

Text: Arca 5.6. HE4.1 “All new development must consider surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness,

Text: Arca taking into account any potential harm resulting from cumulative impact of successive alterations over time.”

Text: D Historical Development Brief History of the Surrounding Area

Text: D Historical Development 1.1. The site lies in The Downs Conservation Area, comprising mainly terraced residential properties from the mid-

Text: D Historical Development Victorian period on.

Text: D Historical Development 1.2. Numbers 72-78 The Downs form a group of red-brick residences with a twin gable frontages at each end, and minor dormer accents in the middle. The properties include simple bay windows with head, sill and pilaster stone features in a simple composition. The gable end of No72 facing New Street is animated by bay and oriel windows, and an asymmetric chimney stack.

Text: D Historical Development 1.3. To the rear are small yards serving the properties that on their north sides back onto the ginnel (alleyway) they share for access and bin storage. The site is bounded by low stone walls and hedges to the front and sides, and a common red brick to the rear ginnel.

Text: D Historical Development 2. Map Regression

Text: D Historical Development 2.1. Maps showing the site through history are shown on the following pages.

Text: D Historical Development 1876 At the time of the first OS Map Series in c. 1876 the site of Nos 72-74 was occupied by a single family house, with an extension outrigger to the rear. The land to the north (now Copperfield Court) is laid out as formal gardens with glasshouses in the centre, but no principal house.

Text: D Historical Development 1898 The 1:500 series at the end of the century shows the house in more detail, with the addition of a new L-shaped building on the boundary immediately to the north. Extensive glasshouses are now shown north of the formal gardens. The land formed by the Downs, Delamer Road and St John’s Road has a detached house erected on it.

Text: D Historical Development 1910 This iteration shows the replacement of the single family house with the four homes currently occupying the site in a short terrace arrangement.

Text: D Historical Development 1936 Cedar Avenue is formed within the site immediately to the north, and the ginnel to the rear of Nos 72-78 appears clearly for the first time.

Text: E Significance E Significance

Text: E Significance 1. Assessing Significance

Text: E Significance 1.1. The purpose of the significance assessment is to use recognised criteria to assess the heritage significance and

Text: E Significance interest of the Site, including specific components which contribute to any special interest.

Text: E Significance 1.2. The significance assessment should be utilised as a baseline document for which to measure ongoing development proposals. The principal aim of the significance assessment is to appraise the Subject Site, identifying various phases of the building and assigning relative significance. This in turn will inform the subsequent design development.

Text: E Significance 1.3. The key criteria to consider are archaeological interest, architectural and artistic interest, and historic interest.

Text: E Significance 1.4. In this instance, the proposals do not propose any removal of historic fabric. Furthermore, the immediate context

Text: E Significance for the new gate comprises plain red brick walls, with no fine architectural or artistic treatment.

Text: E Significance Judgment of Significance

Text: E Significance 2.1. Our judgment is that while the walls are undoubtedly historic, probably dating from the time of the original house

Text: E Significance built in the middle of the C19, they are not of special value.

Text: E Significance 2.2. Notwithstanding this conclusion, they are being retained, and the gate merely screens them somewhat from public

Text: E Significance view. No aspect of the proposed develop detracts from the significance of the historic fabric.

Text: Development Options and Conclusions Development Options and Conclusions

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 1. Options Review

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 1.1. The design of the gate was developed with the following factors in view:

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Respect for the local character

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Use of high quality materials

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Low maintenance

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Some measure of security

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Open construction to allow adequate ventilation of the bin area to be preserved

Text: Development Options and Conclusions • Link of materials with the planting and character of the yards to Nos 72-78

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 1.2. A painted hardwood gate was considered but ruled out on the grounds of maintenance and ventilation. More

Text: Development Options and Conclusions modern material options were not considered, as they would be out of character with the area.

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 1.3. The materials eventually chosen were black painted steel in a replica Victorian style. It is worth pointing out that this improvement to the amenity of the ginnel area is entirely due to the initiative and funds of the Applicant.

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 2. Conclusion

Text: Development Options and Conclusions 2.1. The conclusion is that the gate is an appropriate and high quality response to a practical problem, that enhances the streetscape and The Downs Conservation Area as a whole.
