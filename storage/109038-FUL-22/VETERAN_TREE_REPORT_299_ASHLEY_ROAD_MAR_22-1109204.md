Text: The Brief The Brief

Text: The Brief I have been asked by Wright Landscapes to comment on two Oaks, one of which is classified as veteran and the other as ancient, located within the 7-acre boundary of 299 Ashley Road with a view to providing a management solution for their immediate and future protection.

Text: The Purpose of the Report The Purpose of the Report

Text: The Purpose of the Report The purpose of this report is to help prolong the life of these trees and ensure the continuity of habitat required by many of their associated species.

Text: Classification Classification

Text: Classification Ancient Tree Guide No.4 (ATF, 2008) defines an ancient tree as one “that has passed beyond maturity and is old, or aged in comparison with other trees of the same species”. Similarly, according to current guidance for use in the Ancient Tree Hunt (Owen & Alderman, 2008), an ancient tree is one that has all or most of the following characteristics;

Text: Classification 1. Biological, aesthetic or cultural interest because of its great age.

Text: Classification 2. A growth stage that is described as ancient or post-mature.

Text: Classification 3. A chronological age that is old relative to others of the same species.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal Conclusions/Proposal

Text: Conclusions/Proposal Having identified a veteran, an ancient and a future veteran Oak on the site means we should take on the responsibility of their management. If we can offer a simple solution to reduce some of the stresses the trees are suffering then this opportunity must be taken.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal As detailed later in this report, the main issue with the trees is allowing them space to thrive and to prevent/alleviate soil compaction. A temporary access road has been constructed away from the trees to facilitate the redevelopment of 299 Ashley Road. The new temporary access road has presented us with a one-off opportunity to permanently move the road away from the trees alleviating the compaction and root restricting issues. This act will future proof them for the generations to come. The existing road should be removed after the driveway of 297 Ashley Road to allow sufficient rooting area. A new road should extend the short distance from the driveway across the field to allow for a circular access to prevent vehicles attempting to turn around on the root plate.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal As the temporary access road is on land classified as green belt an application for its permanent status should be submitted to Trafford LPA .

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development Ancientness in Relation to Development

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development The developmental characteristics that tend to develop with increasing age in trees include the following;

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 1. A large girth.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 2. The progressive narrowing of successive annual increments in the stem.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 3. The aging and associated decay leading to the hollowing of the central stem.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 4. Changes to crown architecture.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Tree Health & Soil Compaction

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Oak trees host a multitude of organisms which have evolved with the trees over thousands of years, whilst some may feast upon the tissues of the tree itself, they tend not to result in the death of the tree and we classify these life forms as associates, so there is a balance where no one species has the upper hand. I am not talking about foreign pathogens that sweep the country which is a separate issue. If the tree suffers stresses from either biotic or abiotic factors then the balance can be tipped against the tree which could lead to its decline and death.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Trees require trace elements for all of their physiological functions and these are obtained from within the soil, the fine roots grow through the soil depleting resources then growing into new areas. The roots also respire CO2 which diffuses out of the soil and is replaced by oxygen, this process is called gaseous exchange. Compaction of the soil reduces the soil pore space, gaseous exchange and available water, the tree then produces large amounts of ethanol which stops root growth.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction The compacted soil is causing these trees to decline from the lack of access to new trace elements and available water.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 02

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 03

Text: Soil Density Probe A soil density probe was used to measure the compaction of the soil.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 01: The roadway has approximately 450mm of hardcore underneath it with a plastic support mat. The probe wasn’t able to penetrate.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 02: Multiple areas within the grassed area around the tree were tested and all locations registered no compaction.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 03: The field area on the right has had plant machinery driving over it resulting in the soil compacting so the water cannot drain away. The probe registered compaction resistance at 75mm.

Text: The Trees The Trees

Text: The Trees Looking at all three trees from a distance we can see from the crowns that T1 is in a healthier condition than T2 and T3, with T3 overall being in a worse condition even though this tree is significantly younger. T3 is surrounded by compacted substrate.

Text: The Trees Making improvements to the soil on this site would significantly increase the trees resilience, vigour and vitality.

Text: The Trees T1 Oak has a girth of 6.05m making it an ancient tree. The existing live tissue is functional with healthy vitality. There is epicormic growth which is an indication of vigour. There is plenty of leaf mould within the trunk to support rare species and a large amount of habitat. There is deadwood in the canopy and on the floor. Historically the left side stem has failed though regrowth is present.

Text: The Trees Habitat photographs

Text: The Trees T2 Oak has a girth of 5m making it a veteran tree. The base and trunk are ivy covered so the base could not be assessed. There is more deadwood in the upper canopy and it is showing some signs of decline.

Text: The Trees T3 Oak. This tree is within the boundary of 297 Ashley Road so is not technically part of the report. It is very much in need of being included as this has the potential of becoming a future veteran and therefore its importance should not be understated. The continuity of the landscape is as equally important as the ancient trees. The girth is approximately 800mm and as previously stated is in decline due to the compaction of the substrate. Separate provisions for this tree will follow after consultation with the owner.

Text: Principles for Protection Principles for Protection

Text: Principles for Protection The aim is that there should be no further avoidable loss of ancient trees and to maintain a tree population in which values associated with ancientness are sustained.

Text: Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees

Text: Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees It's important to understand how we view the term ‘decline’ as an organism that lives for hundreds of years may go through periods of decline and regrowth and we would not necessarily see this unless historic photographs exist. The focus should be on providing the best solution to enable its longevity and we can only achieve this by giving trees space for the roots to grow.

Text: How much space How much space

Text: How much space Under the existing British Standard 5837;2012 Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction-Recommendations. It is recommended that a root protection area (RPA) is 10 x the diameter of the stem whereas with veteran trees it is 15 x the diameter of the stem, so a rough guide of a 6m girth tree is a diameter of 2m x 15 = 30m, obviously we are nowhere near having the correct RPA. By allowing the temporary access road to become permanent It will open up a large area of soil giving an opportunity to improve the trees chances of the survival.

Text: How much space The LPA have issued permission for a temporary road to be installed to facilitate the redevelopment.

Text: How much space It is reasonable to conclude that this temporary road should be retained as the main entrance to 299, therefore allowing the removal of the existing old road that passes over the root plates of the two trees. The this will give both trees the soil volume and space that they require. Failure to act could lead to the loss of both trees due to restricted rooting area.

Text: How much space It is recommended that the road directly outside of the gates of 297 is extended a small distance across the field to join up with the new road to allow for ease of access and to stop vehicles driving over the root plate when turning around.

Text: How much space The distance from the stem of T1 to the old road is 4m and to the new road is 24m, this additional gain of rooting zone will be sufficient to increase both trees resilience to climate change and any damage from increased traffic during the build. After the removal of road way, a soil density test should be carried out.

Text: Additional Works Additional Works

Text: Additional Works Pruning works would only be recommended on safety issues or that failure to prune could result in a catastrophic stem failure. The Ivy on T2 should be severed at the base and removed up to 1m off the ground for a basal inspection, the Ivy should be allowed to naturally die off then a re-inspection of the upper stem to check for any safety issues.

Text: Additional Info Additional Info

Text: Additional Info The owner from 297 Ashley Road was spoken with when I visited the site, and he has agreed that it is a reasonable proposition.

Text: Land use & Mitigation Land use & Mitigation

Text: Land use & Mitigation The site would lend itself to the recent popular revival of Medieval pasture land with 15% tree cover and it would support around 5 cow/calves.

Text: Land use & Mitigation Tree selection should include Oak and Hawthorn
