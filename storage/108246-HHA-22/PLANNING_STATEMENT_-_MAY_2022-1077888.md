Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT National Planning Policy Framework

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The National Planning Policy Framework says, in Paragraph 8, that there are 3 overarching objectives to achieving sustainable development. These are an economic role (contributing to the economy), a social role (supporting communities) and an environmental role (protecting and enhancing the natural and built environment).

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 11 requires a presumption in favour of sustainable development

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Section 12 of the NPPF is headed “Achieving well designed places” Paragraph 124 says that: “The creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.”; and that “Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Section 16 of the NPPF “Conserving and enhancing the historic environment” covers heritage matters.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 189 says

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 190 says:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 192 goes on to say

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT “In determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 196 sets out that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimal use.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 197 says that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Paragraph 200 says that “Local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas and World Heritage Sites and within the setting of heritage assets to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of the asset should be treated favourably.”

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The National Design Guide published in October 2019 sets out the characteristics of well- designed places and demonstrates what good design means in practice.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT THE CASE FOR THE APPLICANT Design and Access Considerations

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Design Principles

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The key elements identified in Policy L7 of the Core Strategy have all been important factors in the evolution of the proposed development. The proposed extensions and alterations are of a high quality of design; have good functionality; have been designed to minimise impact on the amenity of occupiers of existing properties and also on the future users of the development itself; regard has also been given to security and accessibility in the detailed design of the property. The proposed extension and alterations have been designed to be energy efficient.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The design advice in the National Design Guide has guided the approach the design of the extensions and alterations, which has been influenced positively by:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the history and heritage of the site, its surroundings and the wider area, including cultural influences;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the significance and setting of heritage assets and any other specific features that merit conserving and enhancing;

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the local vernacular, including historical building typologies such as the terrace, town house, mews, villa or mansion block, the treatment of façades, characteristic materials and details.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Appraisal of context

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The importance of the site’s location within the Devisdale Conservation Area was a key part of the design process. The context includes the surrounding properties on Park Road, including those which are identified as making a positive contribution to the conservation area. This assessment is covered in more detail in the separate heritage statement.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Access

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The premises as extended and altered will meet building regulations in terms of accessibility into and within the property.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Heritage Considerations

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The property is also grade II listed and a separate Heritage Statement accompanies these planning and listed building consent applications.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Figure 2: Townscape analysis (extract from CAA) Key: Cyan = positive contributor; Magenta = Listed building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed extensions and alterations have been specifically designed to a high standard to enhance the property. The proposed extensions have been designed to sit comfortably with the original architecture and local context, by incorporating aspects of the existing house, such as using matching materials and design features.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed materials are of a high quality and are appropriate to the context and setting of the building, and would reflect and echo those used on the existing traditional building and other buildings in the area.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In our view, the character of the property will be maintained, as shown on the design drawings and the proposed extension and alterations enhances the property within the conservation area to which it lies. The extension will not be visible from the street frontage due to the high level of boundary screening to the frontage of the site and the fact that the existing property is well set back from the frontage as shown on the design drawings. Therefore, the impact upon the conservation area and listed building setting is minimal. Taking into account the scale, design and form of the proposed extension and alterations, as well as the mature landscaped

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT screening to the boundaries, these works will not appear over-dominant, obtrusive or out of place in the context of the existing building. Taking into account the siting of the extension and alterations, it is our view that there will be no impact on the setting of any of the adjacent buildings.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed alterations to the existing property also make direct reference to the originally approved scheme in 1950 when the original Vicarage was converted into two separate semi- detached dwellings, whereby various alterations and extensions were intended to be carried out to the property, some of which were carried out. An extract of these original changes can be seen below.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In the context of the scale of the existing house, the extension to the side is small in scale. It is clearly subordinate in scale and single storey. It will be set away from the west boundary. Alterations to the elevations will be well designed and stylistically appropriate. Taking into account this set-back, the design of the proposed alteration to the side elevation, and the scale and height of the extension; it is our view that there will be no impact on the setting of any of the adjacent buildings.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is worth giving consideration as to how to apply the council’s detailed guidelines relating to house extensions and the standing of the property in relation to the adopted conservation area guidelines.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is important to note that SPD4 sets out guidelines, not definitive policy. All properties are different and it is important to look at each individual case on its own merits, looking at the relevant specific locational factors and circumstances. This is acknowledged in paragraph 1.1.3

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT 26a Victoria Road ● Hale ● Cheshire ● WA15 9AD ● t: 0161 928 4433 ● f: 0161 928 4433 e:sales@arcdesignservices.net ● www.arcdesignservices.net

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT of SPD4, which says that “whilst these guidelines seek to provide some clarity on the main issues, there will be situations which are not covered by these guidelines as circumstances vary. All applications are considered individually and on their individual merits”.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT In the context of the consideration of this application it is perhaps most useful to look at whether the development fits within the broad criteria set out in the SPD’s general principles. We would argue that it does, in that:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • It has been carefully designed to harmonise with the character of the dwelling, and neighbouring houses, by reflecting the design, detailing, and proportions of the existing dwelling.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The materials match those on the original house.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The extension is relatively small in scale and is single storey.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The extension would not lead to the loss of any significant trees and the large front and rear garden would be effectively retained.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • There would be no adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties and the surrounding area.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • There would be no adverse impact on the adequacy of the parking provision

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • The proposal represents sustainable design, with a high level of energy efficiency

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development will retain all that is significant that the building contributes to the conservation area and the listed building, as well as the set-back from the street and the overall form of a semi-detached house in modest grounds.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed extension culminates from a well thought out design by an experienced designer, resulting in a high quality development appropriate to its context and which will enhance the building.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT No key views and vistas will be affected.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The development abides by the parameters set out in section 3.3 of the Management Plan, which sets out what is considered inappropriate development within The Devisdale Conservation Area, in that it:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve a significant loss of front garden space in favour of off-road parking

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT respects a sympathetic balance of hard surface area to garden

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve the removal and/or alterations to historic boundary walls, gate posts and/or gate openings

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • whilst it involves a small side extension, the proposed design is well thought out and it will have no adverse impact on the conservation area or listed building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • the extension will not significantly reduce the intervening space between the existing building and plot boundary

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve the subdivision of an existing plot into multiple plots

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve demolition of important features harmful to the conservation area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • involves alterations which are stylistically appropriate and utilise an appropriate palette of materials to complement the existing building

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not involve basement development work which will significantly alter the proportions of a building’s exterior

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development conforms to the policies of the Management Plan in that it:

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • uses appropriate materials and techniques, and uses an appropriate palette of materials

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • does not have an adverse impact on existing boundary treatments

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • has no adverse impact on existing green spaces, the public realm or key views within the Conservation Area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • would not adversely impact on the landscaped quality of the area

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT 26a Victoria Road ● Hale ● Cheshire ● WA15 9AD ● t: 0161 928 4433 ● f: 0161 928 4433 e:sales@arcdesignservices.net ● www.arcdesignservices.net

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Company Registered in England Registration No. 5080042

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT • retains the character of the built environment and has no adverse impact on archaeology.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Even if the council came to the view that there would be harm to the conservation area (and there is no reason why it should), this could not be considered as substantial. There would be a public benefit in that it would allow improvements, which are important in keeping buildings in use, as their improvement makes them more attractive for future custodians.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT It is our view that overall the proposed development preserves the character of the Devisdale Conservation Area as such the proposal is in accordance with national and local policies and guidelines, as well as the advice contained in the National Design Guide.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Impact on residential amenity

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The extension has been designed to ensure that adequate privacy distances are retained to adjacent properties. The extension to the side will project into the area behind the main frontage of the building. Overall, it is our view that new windows on the rear elevation will not raise concerns regarding potential overlooking and interlooking.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT Other matters

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT There are no highways issues arising from this low key development, which will have no adverse impact on the local highway network. Vehicular access and car parking arrangements will remain as existing.

Text: PLANNING POLICY CONTEXT The proposed development will not require any trees to be removed as part of the development therefore it will have no impact upon the landscape character of the area.

Text: CONCLUSION CONCLUSION

Text: CONCLUSION The proposed extension has been carefully designed to respect the original building and the local context. The extensions would preserve the character and appearance of The Devisdale Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal passes the statutory test in Section 72 of the Planning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990. The extension and alterations will have little or no adverse impact on nearby buildings.

Text: CONCLUSION It is considered that the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF and Core Strategy Policies R1.1, R1.2, R1.3, R1.6, R1.7, R1.9 and L7. Planning permission should be granted.
