Text: Introduction 20 Sandiway constitutes the Northern end of a terrace of dwellings built circa 1835- 1852

Text: Introduction “Nos. 16-20 (even) Sandiway Place Date: Between 1835-52 Condition: Good These three houses in a terrace are included as they are elegant properties which retain original features and attractive small front gardens.”

Text: Introduction “Nos. 16-20 Sandiway Place is a two-storey terrace of brickwork and slate roofs. The front and side elevations are of buff brick to match Nos. 13-21 Sandiway Road; similarly, there are some bricks which have lost their smooth faces. Additionally, there are areas of atmospheric staining which would benefit from cleaning. The stone window heads have been painted. No. 18 also has painted brickwork at plinth level. All have timber sash windows and original doors in good condition. The roof has some slipped and cracked slates and there are also some poorly bedded ridge tiles. The chimneys, also in buff brick, appear in good condition”

Text: Introduction The building has an unusual line of junction of ownership with its adjoining neighbour and there are a number of flying freeholds and legacy ownership arrangements

Text: Introduction The building has a basement, with internal access stairs and with a separate side access.

Text: Introduction The building has a number of internal level changes but essentially four floors of accommodation from basement level to attic level.

Text: Introduction The building comprises a corner plot between Sandiway Road and Sandiway Place.

Text: Introduction The side and rear garden is effectively screened from public view by an existing garden wall and hedge.

Text: Introduction The property has a single storey rear outrigger which contained an external wc and associated outbuildings/ coal store, and this has been previously extended with an unusual and lightweight part masonry and part timber, glass roofed structure. This existing rear extension is in poor condition, has a limited life span, is not insulated and has an awkward step to the main kitchen space. It is not attractive in appearance, but has been constructed ostensibly of similar materials to the existing house: vernacular cheshire brickwork, timber doors and windows; slate roof (albeit of an inadequate pitch creating a latent defect); and PVCu/ PPC aluminium roof elements.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance Assessment of Heritage Significance

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The property is not a listed building or a designated heritage asset of national importance

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The property is not understood to have been identified by the LA as having locally Listed status

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The property is within a Conservation Area and has been identified as a “positive contributor” by the LA

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance Proposal:

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance It is proposed to replace the existing rear extension with a new rear extension. The proposed form is to reflect the existing outrigger which forms the ancillary utility room and boot room and have a set back more subservient flat roof element taking the place of the current lean-to structure. The relationship to the kitchen is improved and the existing level changes rationalised.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The rear of the existing terrace is comprised of single storey rear extensions of varying sizes, forms and materials, and the existing rear element of the adjoining neighbour comprises a series of roofed rear extensions.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The proposal projects a little further into the rear garden than the existing condition, but when read against the neighbouring forms is not excessive. The new build also presents the opportunity to form a new boundary parapet wall to remove the current construction weak point of multiple levels, flashings and potential water ingress and unsatisfactory detailing.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The property currently has two double gates and two separate driveways. The driveway furthest from the house has a detached garage which is in poor condition.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance The owner parks in the driveway closest to the house, but this is not ideal as it then detracts from the garden view from the house. The proposal is to remove the existing garage, slightly adjust the existing gatepost by circa 500mm, to better accommodate modern cars and then adjust the existing driveway within the site to take two cars side by side.

Text: Assessment of Heritage Significance In place of the existing garage, it is proposed to construct a new car port with a storage/ garden room in the roof space. The height and positioning of this new carport is based on a recently constructed and approved garage at the neighbouring 29 Burlington Rd (Application Number: 90246/HHA/17)

Text: Assessment of Impact Assessment of Impact

Text: Assessment of Impact The proposed extension works seek replicate the form and scale of the existing rear extensions and outbuildings

Text: Assessment of Impact Timber cladding

Text: Assessment of Impact The proposed extension is an improvement over the existing extensions which have latent defects within them due to their poor construction and numerous additions/ adaptations over time. These would be made good to ensure the long-term sustainability of the building.

Text: Assessment of Impact Overall, the visual impact of the proposals within the context of the site and the wider context will be minimal. The proposals have been designed to be sympathetic to the existing property and its context, utilising traditional design and materials to ensure minimal impact. We have taken the context into consideration during the design process and believe that the proposals will improve the existing situation whilst still preserving the character of the local area. The materials used will be traditional in style utilizing butted timber with locking battens to

Text: Assessment of Impact give a lightweight and more temporary appearance. As such it will continue to preserve and enhance the local area and will be a harmonious addition to the local environment.

Text: Assessment of Impact The proposals will not adversely impact the Conservation Area and be a harmonious addition to the local environment. They have a negligible impact on the existing dwelling and seek to enhance the building, helping allowing it to remain in use as a high quality, dwelling, fit for modern living, for the long term.
