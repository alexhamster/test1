Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 5.1 Dust suppression

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Dust is created on the site, during most stages of construction and will be managed throughout the construction phase. Measures will be taken to minimise and control dust on site through industry standard measures. During the demolition works fog misters will be used.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Internal works – the potential for creating dust will be minimised using dust extraction on equipment, good ventilation, and good housekeeping as well as through the selection and use of appropriate materials and equipment.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Generally good housekeeping will be employed to reduce the amount of dust created. The Principal Contractor in conjunction with its sub-contractors will ensure dust generated from site activities does not become a risk to others and in doing so shall assess the dust risk for each work package, ensure adequate controls are in place and review these controls with their contractors.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Measures will be taken to eliminate, or at least minimize, dust generation with consideration given to material usage, type of work equipment used, and work methods applied. Where dust creation is unavoidable, dampening down techniques will be applied.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Because there will be minimal excavation work and this will all be contained within the site, it is likely that there will be no requirement for dedicated wheel washing facilities but, if necessary, wheels will be cleaned before accessing the Public Highway. Also, should any excavated materials be deposited on the highway, these will be removed using a road sweeper machine.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Emission of dust and other particulates shall be controlled by implementing the following measures:

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 1. ensure no burning of waste materials takes place on site

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 2. ensure an adequate water supply on the site to allow dust suppression.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 3. ensure disposal of run-off water from dust suppression activities, in accordance with the appropriate legal requirements.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 4. ensure regular cleaning of hard standings using wet sweeping methods

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 5. not allow dry sweeping of large areas

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 6. movement of site vehicles/lorries will be practically minimised as the intention is to re- use the majority of the material the permanent works, however, any vehicles that exit the site will be cleaned before accessing the Public Highway

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 7. routinely clean public roads and access routes using wet sweeping methods

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 8. ensure vehicles working on site have exhausts positioned such that the risk of re-suspension of ground dust is minimised (exhausts should preferably point upwards), where reasonably practicable

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 9. ensure all vehicles carrying loose or potentially dusty material are fully sheeted

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 10. store materials with the potential to produce dust away from site boundaries where reasonably practicable

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 11. ensure sand and other aggregates are not allowed to dry out

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 12. minimise the amount of excavated material held on site

Text: 5.2 Noise 5.2 Noise

Text: 5.2 Noise As part of the pre-planning process of work activities, those works, which may bring about excessive or high levels of noise will be pre-assessed, including the impact upon construction operatives and residents/neighbours in nearby premises.

Text: 5.2 Noise The requirements described within The Noise at Work Regulations 2005 and the British Standard BS 5228 Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites will be adhered to fully.

Text: 5.2 Noise In brief, the principal contractor will limit as much as is practical high noise operations and where this is unavoidable measures will be taken, such as the selection of plant and equipment or work processes, which does not emit high noise levels or equipment, which is fitted with silencing/anti- vibration equipment.

Text: 5.2 Noise Noisy equipment will be sited as far away from occupied premises as possible and turned off when not in use. Noise paths will be restricted by the placement of enclosures/barriers where practical.

Text: 5.2 Noise The above measures will be considered as part of the assessment process, which will identify noisy hazards, estimate likely exposure to noise by construction operatives and any other persons likely to be affected, identify measures required to eliminate or reduce noise exposure, and make persons likely to be affected by noise aware of the risks and controls which are being taken.

Text: 5.2 Noise Full liaison will occur with affected neighbours as part of the pre-planning of construction work activities and every effort will be made to minimise the impact upon their work activities as described above and to work in cooperation with tenants regarding any specific requirements they may have, including restricting high-level noise during key times. (Consideration will also be given to works occurring outside of normal works hours, where noise levels cannot be satisfactorily reduced).

Text: 5.2 Noise Noise monitoring will occur during potential noisy activities and where the action levels are exceeded as identified within the Noise at Work Regulations (see below), then appropriate action will be taken.

Text: 5.2 Noise Lower exposure action level is a daily or weekly exposure of 80db and a peak sound pressure of 135db

Text: 5.2 Noise Upper exposure action level is a daily or weekly exposure of 85db and a peak sound pressure of 137db

Text: 5.2 Noise Additionally, liaison will also occur with the local authority regarding any restrictions they have and ensuring minimal impact upon neighbours.

Text: 5.2 Noise The ground improvement technique proposed to support building sub-structure - Rigid Inclusion Columns, up to 16m length, are proposed to improve the ground to the footprint areas of the proposed buildings only, to provide the required foundation and floor slab loading capacities. The installation procedure is an augering solution and therefore a low noise/vibration technique. Noise will be in line with site traffic, vibration will be very low, less than 5mm per/s.

Text: 5.2 Noise We do not anticipate any plant or machinery, including generators to be left running overnight.

Text: 5.2 Noise Loading areas will be kept away from canal side and neighbouring business where possible.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 5.1 Dust suppression

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Dust is created on the site, during most stages of construction and will be managed throughout the construction phase. Measures will be taken to minimise and control dust on site through industry standard measures. During the demolition works fog misters will be used.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Internal works – the potential for creating dust will be minimised using dust extraction on equipment, good ventilation, and good housekeeping as well as through the selection and use of appropriate materials and equipment.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Generally good housekeeping will be employed to reduce the amount of dust created. The Principal Contractor in conjunction with its sub-contractors will ensure dust generated from site activities does not become a risk to others and in doing so shall assess the dust risk for each work package, ensure adequate controls are in place and review these controls with their contractors.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Measures will be taken to eliminate, or at least minimize, dust generation with consideration given to material usage, type of work equipment used, and work methods applied. Where dust creation is unavoidable, dampening down techniques will be applied.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Because there will be minimal excavation work and this will all be contained within the site, it is likely that there will be no requirement for dedicated wheel washing facilities but, if necessary, wheels will be cleaned before accessing the Public Highway. Also, should any excavated materials be deposited on the highway, these will be removed using a road sweeper machine.

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression Emission of dust and other particulates shall be controlled by implementing the following measures:

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 1. ensure no burning of waste materials takes place on site

Text: 5.1 Dust suppression 2. ensure an adequate water supply on the site to allow dust suppression.

Text: 5.2 Noise 5.2 Noise

Text: 5.2 Noise As part of the pre-planning process of work activities, those works, which may bring about excessive or high levels of noise will be pre-assessed, including the impact upon construction operatives and residents/neighbours in nearby premises.

Text: 5.2 Noise The requirements described within The Noise at Work Regulations 2005 and the British Standard BS 5228 Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites will be adhered to fully.

Text: 5.2 Noise In brief, the principal contractor will limit as much as is practical high noise operations and where this is unavoidable measures will be taken, such as the selection of plant and equipment or work processes, which does not emit high noise levels or equipment, which is fitted with silencing/anti- vibration equipment.

Text: 5.2 Noise Noisy equipment will be sited as far away from occupied premises as possible and turned off when not in use. Noise paths will be restricted by the placement of enclosures/barriers where practical.

Text: 5.2 Noise The above measures will be considered as part of the assessment process, which will identify noisy hazards, estimate likely exposure to noise by construction operatives and any other persons likely to be affected, identify measures required to eliminate or reduce noise exposure, and make persons likely to be affected by noise aware of the risks and controls which are being taken.

Text: 5.2 Noise Full liaison will occur with affected neighbours as part of the pre-planning of construction work activities and every effort will be made to minimise the impact upon their work activities as described above and to work in cooperation with tenants regarding any specific requirements they may have, including restricting high-level noise during key times. (Consideration will also be given to works occurring outside of normal works hours, where noise levels cannot be satisfactorily reduced).

Text: 5.2 Noise Noise monitoring will occur during potential noisy activities and where the action levels are exceeded as identified within the Noise at Work Regulations (see below), then appropriate action will be taken.

Text: 5.2 Noise Lower exposure action level is a daily or weekly exposure of 80db and a peak sound pressure of 135db

Text: 5.2 Noise Upper exposure action levels is a daily or weekly exposure of 85db and a peak sound pressure of 137db

Text: 5.2 Noise Additionally, liaison will also occur with the local authority regarding any restrictions they have and ensuring minimal impact upon neighbours.

Text: 5.2 Noise Any noisy works such as piling will be mitigated as much as reasonably practical. We do not anticipate any plant or machinery, including generators to be left running overnight.
