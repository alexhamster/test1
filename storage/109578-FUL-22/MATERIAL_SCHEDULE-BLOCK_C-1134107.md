Text: Façade Painting Specification Façade Painting Specification

Text: Façade Painting Specification Before you paint ensure you have properly prepared the area.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • New brickwork with cement mortar should be left to set for a minimum of 28 days before painting.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Check your brickwork for any defects. A build-up of white crystal salts on the surface is called efflorescence and needs to be removed before painting. To remove any efflorescence, wipe down the bricks with a 5% solution of white vinegar and water, hose down then allow to dry.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Check the bricks for any water damage. Any leaks, damp rising or excess moisture will need to be addressed before painting.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Ensure the surface is clear of any loose sand or cement. Fill holes with grouting cement.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Wash down with water using a stiff brush to remove all loose material.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Use a good quality masking tape along any edges you don’t want to paint, including trims or windows.

Text: Façade Painting Specification • Carry out Water Bead test to make sure water soaks into bricks. If not, the paint may not be suitable for the brick type.

Text: Façade Painting Specification Painting your bricks – Dulux Weathershield - RAL 9016 Matt Finish

Text: Façade Painting Specification New Brickwork requires 3 Coats of Dulux Weathershield :

Text: Façade Painting Specification 1st coat Mist Coat using Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint (watered down 15-20%) 2nd Coat Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint 3rd Coat Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint

Text: Façade Painting Specification Cut in around the edges and hard to reach areas with an angled brush.

Text: Façade Painting Specification Using an 18-nap roller, load the tray with a reasonable amount of paint.

Text: Façade Painting Specification Start rolling the wall in an ‘M’ pattern. Continue over the same section until the wall is evenly covered. Roll up to area of 1m2 size or paint the wall in sections. Before paint starts to dry, using an unloaded roller, begin in the top left corner of your wall and gently let the roller roll down to the base in a straight line with no pressure. Repeat this action only this time, slightly overlap your last movement so your roller rubs away the line created by the previous stroke. Continue this across the area you have painted. This is called laying off. Once the first coat is dry, approximately 2 hours in normal conditions, repeat the total process again for the 2nd coat then leave to dry before applying a final 3rd coat.
