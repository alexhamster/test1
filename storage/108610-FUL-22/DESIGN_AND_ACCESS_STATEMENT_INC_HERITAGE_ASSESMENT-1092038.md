Text: Development of the scheme. As stated in the above, the desire is to produce a more sympathetic shop front reflecting the character of the conservation are and the principals set out in Trafford Council Planning Guidelines – Shopfronts dated July 1997. (See appendix 1)

Text: Development of the scheme. Design – This reflects the character of the Conservation Area and the predominance of frontage constructed from painted soft wood.

Text: Assessment. Key Planning Issues

Text: Assessment. The use of the site has already been established and as such the key issues are:

Text: Assessment. 1. Design of the shopfront and the impact on the heritage assets in terms of the Conservation Area and nearby buildings of significance.

Text: Assessment. Local/National Policy.

Text: Assessment. The site is located in the main commercial centre of Altrincham and already has an established use as a restaurant, use class A3.

Text: Assessment. Town Centre Policies S3 Improving the Main Shopping Centres and S6 Development in Altrincham Town Centre are particularly relevant to this site as is Supplementary Planning Documents PG 17 Shopfronts and D1 relating to all new development.

Text: Assessment. In addition, the site is within a Conservation Area and, as such, the impact on Heritage assets is important.

Text: Assessment. P a g e | 3

Text: Assessment. Location within the Old Market Place Conservation Area

Text: Assessment. SPD 5.3 identifies the site as being within Character Zone D, The Civic and Commercial Area.

Text: Assessment. The appraisal is silent about the property other than mentioning it was included in the 2014 revision to the conservation area boundaries.

Text: Assessment. The appraisal references the traditional style shop fronts and it does identify the property as having a positive impact on the character of the area.

Text: Assessment. The alleyway at the rear of the site is not a ‘through route’ and, as such the impact of the new shopfront structure will be limited on the character of the conservation area fronting Shaws Road.

Text: Assessment. The NPPF supports sustainable town centre development in para 86 and states that policies should ‘promote competitive town centres that provide customer choice and a diverse retail offer and which reflect the individuality of town centres;’

Text: Assessment. Para 81 says ‘Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business’. In this case the development is to allow the business to recover and trade effectively following the commercial impacts that it has suffered during the pandemic.

Text: Assessment. In terms of the impact on Historic Assets, Para 194 says The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no

Text: Assessment. more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.

Text: Assessment. Para 202 says ‘Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use’

Text: Assessment. In this case the development of this new shopfront, of a traditional appearance will have less than significant harm to the conservation area and will allow the business to secure its optimum viable use and as such is acceptable.

Text: Assessment. In addition the new entrance will allow a minimum of 900mm for access, meaning the wheelchairs will be able to use the doorway.

Text: Assessment. And in para 197, ‘In assessing and determining development proposals, local planning authorities should apply the presumption in favour of sustainable development.’

Text: Assessment. The proposal is for a traditional painted timber and glazed shopfront reflecting the character of many of the older retail units in the conservation area.

Text: Assessment. Consequently, there will be no harm to the conservation area character and the improvements to access for people with disabilities will support the aspirations of para 197.

Text: Assessment. In this case, it is clear that the development is sustainable in that it will also bringing into full time use, the premisses and provide an active frontage for the majority of the day, in the key area of Altrincham Town Centre.
