Text: Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY

Text: Garry Miller Heritage CONSULTANCY Garry Miller is a heritage consultant, architectural historian and published author who has spent more than 35 years studying and working with buildings of town and countryside, in particular those of North West England. His career as a consultant began in the mid-1980s with the Preston-based Nigel Morgan Historic Building Consultancy, of which he became a partner in 1992 upon its rebranding as Datestone. In 1997 he was commissioned by the Heritage Trust for the North West, a buildings preservation trust based at Barrowford, Lancashire, to produce an in-depth regional study of vernacular houses in southwest Lancashire: the result, Historic Houses in Lancashire: The Douglas Valley, 1300-1770 was published in 2002. The book was described as ‘scholarship as its best’ by Country Life (June 2003), and ‘well analysed and presented’ in Transactions of the Ancient Monuments Society (Vol 48, 2004); and was widely cited in the 2006 Buildings of England volume on Liverpool and Southwest Lancashire. Extensive research on the houses of Georgian and Regency Liverpool has also been undertaken, with a view to future publication. Following the success of his Douglas Valley book, Garry Miller established his own consultancy, producing analytical and interpretive reports on historic buildings, in particular the heritage assessments required to support planning applications affecting the historic environment. His area of operation encompasses the North West, Midlands, North Wales and parts of Cumbria and North and West Yorkshire. Several local authorities have cited his assessments as examples of best practice, and reports on more than 150 buildings or sites are produced annually.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report supports proposed works at The Old Vicarage, Bowdon, in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester. As the name suggests the property was built as the vicarage to St Mary’s parish church in 1863-1864, but has been subsequently subdivided to form two private residence, The Old Vicarage and Denehill. Together they form a single Grade II listing, and stand within Devisdale Conservation Area.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Proposals have been submitted to Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council for an extension, alterations and landscaping at The Old Vicarage. The heritage considerations arising are the proposal’s impact upon the significance (i.e. heritage interest and value) of the listed building and its setting along with the significance of the conservation area. The scope and purpose of this report is to identify this significance and to evaluate how it will be affected.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Grade II designation of The Old Vicarage and Denehill denotes a building of national importance for its special architectural and historic interest. Its significance essentially derives from this intrinsic special interest and can be summarised as follows:

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its architectural and historic interest as an example of an early 1860s vicarage in Victorian Gothic style

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • The elements and features which date from this period and thereby define its character and appearance

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its historical interest as an example of the work of William Hayward Brakspear, a notable Manchester architect

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its historical and communal association with St Mary’s parish church as a place of worship within the village

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Its setting on the edge of the historic village core, amid the 19th century villas on Park Road

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For similar reasons, the listed building also makes a positive contribution to the conservation area, but only in terms of what can be publicly seen. The interior, and the private rear and gardens, do not contribute as they cannot be seen. An adjoining modern garage, conspicuous and of no interest, makes a negative contribution to both the setting of the listed building and to the character and appearance of the conservation area.

Text: 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As will be examined in this report, it is concluded that the works will sustain the significance of the listed building and will also enhance its external appearance, and that of the site generally. Its contribution to the conservation area will be similarly enhanced. The proposal is therefore in accordance with national planning guidance and the local development plan, and therefore merits approval without delay.

Text: 2: THE SITE 2: THE SITE

Text: 2: THE SITE The proposal building is located in the village of Bowdon, in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, Greater Manchester. As its name suggests, The Old Vicarage was formerly the vicarage of the village’s parish church of St Mary. It stands on Park Road around 250 metres southwest of the church where the ancient village core meets the surrounding 19th century villa suburbia built for affluent commuting Manchester businessmen. A large detached property standing within spacious gardens, the house was subdivided into two private dwellings – The Old Vicarage to the west and Denehill to the east – when its original role ceased in the mid-20th century.

Text: 3: THE PROPOSAL/BACKGROUND TO THIS REPORT Paragraph 194 of Chapter 16 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (as revised, July 2021) states local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of the heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The scope and purpose of this report is therefore to describe the significance of the listed building and conservation area and to assess how this will be affected by the proposal. It is considered the level of detail presented is, in accordance with paragraph 194, proportionate to the importance of the heritage assets, and no more than is necessary to understand the proposal’s impact.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING 4.1 Overview

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING Large Victorian Gothic former vicarage of dark brick with minimal polychrome brickwork details, now subdivided to form two dwellings.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING 4.2 Historical summary

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING The Old Vicarage dates from1863-1864, and designed by Manchester architect William Hayward Brakspear (1818-1898), who was responsible for rebuilding the parish church of St Mary in 1858-1860. The cost was just over £3,000. The following account of the vicarage appeared in The British Architect of February 6, 1874:

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING Bowdon, the beautiful retreat for the wealthy classes of Manchester, has been several times brought under the notice of our subscribers, and again furnishes us with a subject for illustration. The new vicarage house and stables were erected by the late Archdeacon Pollock, in the years 1863-64, from Queen Anne's Bounty Fund in part, and in part also from a profit derived from an exchange of land with Lord Stamford. It stands on an acre and a quarter of land, within sight of the church, and on the highroad from Bowdon to Dunham. Mr Breakspear, of Manchester, who had then recently carried out most successfully the rebuilding, extension, and restoration of the fine old Parish Church, was professionally engaged to carry out the work. The whole external elevations are faced with common brick—white-headers—having Stourton stone dressings. The roofs are covered with Welsh slates. The chimney terminals were designed by the architect to avoid smoke and down draughts. At a future time we hope to give the view from the highroad, with a plan, and possibly some further remarks ; in the meantime it may be both valuable and interesting to furnish the total cost somewhat in detail. The amount of the Builder's contract for works generally was £2,319 10s 5d. Reserved Account: cost of grates, ranges, chimneypieces, marble bath, and slab to lavatory, £117 12s; heating apparatus, £10; boundary walls and gates, £112 12s; ornamental tiling and cement, cellar floors, £36. 12. 6d.; gas mains and polished-brass furniture, £88. 12s 6d ; ironmongery and lightning conductor, £55 7s 2d; ornamental glass, £3 12s. 6d; asphalt work in yard, £5 17s; laying out of grounds, planting with trees and shrubs, carriage way, drainage, £121; Architect's commission, £142;

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING charge for plans for Bounty Office, £10. Total, £3,022 16s. 1d.

Text: 4: THE LISTED BUILDING The property as built stood in a large wooded plot, with a small outbuilding (probably the stables referred to in the description above) to the west. It remained in use as the vicarage until the 1950s when replaced by Windy Ridge on Church Brow, which was built as a private house in the 1930s. The conversion to the present two dwellings occurred thereafter, along with the subdivision of the plot to build a new dwelling, The Orchard, to the west.

Text: 4.2 List description 4.2 List description

Text: 4.2 List description The National Heritage List for England description of The Old Vicarage and Denehill, compiled at the time of designation in 1985, incorrectly gives its date as 1873. It reads:

Text: 4.2 List description Vicarage, now two houses. Said to be 1873. Header bond brick, stone dressings, slate roof. 4 x 3 bays with central staircase and 2 storeys plus attic. Stone quoins, first floor string, coped gables. Bay 1 has 2 pointed lights on each floor with cusped heads and polychromatic brick voussoirs and a roped gable. Bays 2 and 3 form a tower-like entrance feature with weathered buttresses, a 2-light tracery-headed window, 3 cusped lights on the first floor which is canted in plan, and a swept mansard roof which is supported on timber brackets and includes a half-hipped attic dormer window. Bay 4 is similar to 1 except that a 3- light ground floor and 2-light first floor window have flattened arch heads and the mansard gable accommodates a double attic light. The sides and rear are treated similarly the rear having 2 canted bay windows with similar Gothic

Text: 4.2 List description lights.

Text: 4.3 Further analysis 4.3 Further analysis

Text: 4.3 Further analysis The principal interest of the building is in its front and rear elevations, which, with their sober brickwork, minimal polychrome detailing and traceried windows convey the core character and interest of the listed building. The side elevation is plain by comparison, the explanation being that this was originally the ‘working’ end of the building, facing an enclosed yard in which the stables stood. The side door which currently forms the entrance to the application property appears to date from the 1950s subdivision, and the hall within has had a WC inserted. Adjoining the entrance a single-storey projection housing what was probably a scullery originally and is now a kitchen, again a result of the subdivision. Facing it is a double garage, a probably mid-20th century structure of no interest which is visible from the streetscene.

Text: 5.1 Overview 5.1 Overview

Text: 5.1 Overview The Devisdale Conservation Area was first designated in 1974. It covers a large and area straddling the western fringe of Altrincham and its boundary with neighbouring Bowdon. Primarily residential, it also includes the landmark Church of St Margaret, a lawn tennis club and several nursing homes. The application building stands in the southern portion of the conservation area (Map 4, below).

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest 5.2 Character and special interest

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest The special qualities of the conservation area are described in the character area appraisal adopted by Trafford MBC in 2016. This summarises its special interest as follows:

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The Devisdale, from which the conservation area takes its name, is a historic area of unenclosed flat land on the summit of Bowdon Hill

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • In the second half of the 19th century the area was developed by the Earl of Stamford to create a high-class, low-density residential suburb for prosperous commuting Manchester businessmen

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • This is typified by houses, often on a grand scale, set in large gardens with sweeping drives and coach houses

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The properties display a great variety of style, with some designed by renowned architects

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The residential area is characterised by the boundary treatments and mature trees along the roads and in gardens

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • Streets are lined with low garden walls of large stone blocks, with hedges of various species above and trees along the boundary.

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • While many of the roads belong to the planned Victorian development, others pre-date this period, such as Bowdon Road, the historic route between Altrincham and Bowdon Parish Church

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The gradients create views which embody the character of the area, including glimpses of St Margaret’s tower and along individual tree-lined roads

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The area was characterised in the 19th century by a lively and vigorous social, sporting and intellectual life

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • Several road and house names refer to “Racefield” suggesting horse racing took place. From 1896, The Devisdale was the site of the annual Altrincham Show, one of the largest agricultural shows in England

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • A much-valued open space, The Devisdale was gifted by the Earl of Stamford to the people of Altrincham in the 1930s

Text: 5.2 Character and special interest • The conservation area provides numerous and varied habitats for wildlife

Text: 6: summary of significance 6: summary of significance

Text: 6: summary of significance 6.1 Rationale

Text: 6: summary of significance Paragraph 195 of the National Planning Policy Framework states local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of a heritage asset, including its setting, and take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal in order to avoid or minimize conflict between the asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal. Significance is defined in the NPPF Glossary as:

Text: 6: summary of significance The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset's physical presence, but also from its setting.

Text: 6: summary of significance 6.2 The listed building

Text: 6: summary of significance The Grade II designation of The Old Vicarage and Denehill denotes a building of national importance for its special architectural and historic interest. Its significance essentially derives from this intrinsic special interest and can be summarised as follows:

Text: 6.3 The conservation area 6.3 The conservation area

Text: 6.3 The conservation area The significance of The Devisdale Conservation Area derives from its character and appearance as a prestigious suburb established by the Earl of Stamford in the mid-19th century for affluent Manchester commuters. It is characterised by detached and semi detached villas, often on a grand scale and designed by leading architects, set in large gardens along tree- lined roads. The area is primarily residential but also contains the historic open space of The Devisdale and the landmark church of St Margaret. The conservation area is divided into five character areas, of which the application property stands within area C, which is characterised by a mixture of historic properties, including large villas and modern developments. While the significance of the conservation area extends primarily to the borough-wide context, it contains several buildings listed as being of national importance.

Text: 7: planning policy context 7: planning policy context

Text: 7: planning policy context 7.1 Statutory duty

Text: 7: planning policy context Section 66 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires local planning authorities to give special regard to the desirability of preserving a listed building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest. Section 72 (1) requires local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character of a conservation area.

Text: 7: planning policy context 7.2 Relevant polices

Text: 7: planning policy context Chapter 16 of the Revised National Planning Policy Framework provides the guidance on how the statutory duty is to be put into practice. Paragraph 197 states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: 7: planning policy context • The desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation

Text: 7: planning policy context • The positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and

Text: 7: planning policy context • The desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness

Text: 7: planning policy context Regarding designated heritage assets, paragraph 199 states that ‘great weight’ should be given to their conservation and the more important the asset, the greater that weight should be; that significance can be lost through development within its setting.

Text: 7: planning policy context The local planning context is established by policies of Trafford Council’s Core Strategy, adopted January 25, 2012, along with saved policies of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan, adopted June 2006. Relevant to this application is policy R1 of the Core Strategy (Historic Environment), which states:

Text: 7: planning policy context R1.1 All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.

Text: 7: planning policy context R1.2 Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8: Impact of the proposal

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8.1 The extension

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal The proposed extension is to provide a porch, kitchen and utility room and is to be attached to the west elevation of the listed building. As noted above, this elevation is more functional and hence there are relatively few features that will be affected or obscured. The principal alteration is widening of the existing entrance, which does not appear original and dates probably from the 1950s subdivision. The adjoining window is to be retained. In terms of scale, the extension is subservient to the listed building, which will remain predominant in public streetscene views. Its appearance and detailing replicate the Victorian Gothic of the original building and thus avoids any sense of architectural discordance. The impact of the extension is accordingly considered a neutral one, in respect of both the listed building itself and its contribution to the conservation area.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal 8.2 Alterations/other works

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal a. Existing kitchen. New internal steps will be created to the basement, and new partitions inserted to form a WC. The room has been altered to accommodate its present use and no visible historic features will be lost. The works will therefore have a neutral impact.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal b. Entrance hall. The existing non-original WC and partitions, inserted following the 1950s subdivision of the property, will be removed, reinstating the former proportions of the hall. The effect of these works will be positive.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal c. Lounge. A new doorway will be created to access the proposed kitchen. This has a minor adverse impact in terms of fabric loss, but this is not considered sufficient to damage the significance of the building in overall terms.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal d. Creation of bathroom on attic floor. This involves subdivision of the existing bedrooms, blocking of an existing doorway and relocation of the two existing doors and frames. These rooms are plain and functional (being servants’ rooms originally) and no historic features will be lost. The works will have a neutral effect.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal e. External refurbishment. Brickwork is to be cleaned using conservation-approved methods and traditional materials. Gutters are to be similarly cleaned and chimneys and pots repaired as necessary. These works will enhance the appearance of the building, and its visual role within the conservation area, and are therefore positive.

Text: 8: Impact of the proposal f. Internal features. All original features are to be retained and protected during the work. Plasterwork will be repaired where necessary on a like-for-like basis. All new doors, architraves, skirting, cornices etc are to match the original. These works will have a positive effect.

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 8.3 Garage/landscaping

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping The existing detractive modern garage is to be removed and a landscaping scheme introduced in the gardens to the front side and rear, as fully detailed elsewhere in the submitted documentation. These works will therefore enhance the setting of the building and, in respect of those to the front and side, how it is seen publicly from within the conservation area.

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 11. Visualisation showing how the landscaping works will appear in public view

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping 8.4 Conclusion

Text: 8.3 Garage/landscaping For the reasons given above, the works will sustain the significance of the listed building and will also enhance its external appearance, and that of the site generally. Its contribution to the conservation area will be similarly enhanced. The proposal is therefore in accordance with national guidance and the local development plan, and therefore merits approval without delay.
