Care must be taken that any silts within the pipework are not unnecessarily flushed into the attenuation structures (use of bungs and jet-vac of chamber prior to removal of bungs) High pressure jet-wash all perforated pipework and or access points. All water to be jet vac to remove any suspended silts within the water Pervious surfaces need to be regularly cleaned of silt and sediment to preserve their infiltration capacity Jet wash if visible signs of silt and rubber build up. Further maintenance options include locally removing block and geotextile, removing the silt/rubber and replacing as before Remove and reconstruct soakaway and/or replace or Twice yearly (spring, start of winter), or as required Monthly (during growing season), or as required Twice yearly, or as required Five yearly, or as required Yearly, often less where inspections indicate that it is not required Paving to be inspected every spring (when dry) As required
