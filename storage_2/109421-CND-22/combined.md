Pod Point will manage these limits to mitigate any signiﬁcant effects on vehicle charging overall.

Text: Limitations of use Limitations of use

Text: Limitations of use ● Pod Point do not authorise the use of charging cable adaptors and “smart” cables due to their impact on safety.* Our chargers must only be used with European certiﬁed vehicles and cables (damaged or non-approved cables should not be used with any EVSE or vehicles).

Text: Limitations of use *BS EN61851-1 forbids the use of in cable adaptors and cables that change the operational state of the EVSE (smart cables).

Text: Warranty and support Warranty and support

Text: Warranty and support To maintain our warranty, the installation shall be in accordance with Pod Point’s guidance, comply with relevant legislation and be installed by a certiﬁed electrician.

Text: Warranty and support Any hardware failure should be promptly reported to us, ideally by visit our contact-us page You must quote the serial number and location of the product with a brief description of the failure.

Text: Warranty and support Our Support team will then investigate and attempt to remotely resolve the issue. They may ask you to provide additional information to assist in this.

Text: Warranty and support If the issue cannot be resolved remotely, and the product is within warranty, we will arrange for one of our team to visit. If the issue is a result of any shortcoming in design or manufacture it will be made good free of charge or, at our option, exchanged for a replacement product. If we attend the site and the fault is not a result of a design or manufacture issue of our product, we will make reasonable attempts to diagnose the issue and propose a resolution which may have an associated fee. A call out fee will be applicable where our product is not at fault.
