Text: Contents 1.0 Introduction

Text: Contents 1.1 This Heritage Impact Assessment has been prepared on behalf of Mr Adam Fadle in support of a full planning application for the demolition of an existing dwelling and the erection of a replacement dwelling with associated hard and soft landscaping works at 1 Bow Green Road, Bowdon, Altrincham, WA14 3LZ (Plate 1).

Text: Contents 1.2 The application site contains no known heritage assets but is located within the boundary of the Bowdon Conservation Area. Conservation Areas are designated heritage assets which are afforded protection both in planning policy and law.

Text: Contents 1.3 Paragraph 194 of the National Planning Policy Framework (‘NPPF’) requires applicants to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected by a development proposal with a view to understanding the potential impact upon their significance. This Heritage Impact Assessment aims to satisfy the requirements of NPPF Paragraph 194.

Text: Contents 1.4 For context, an application for full planning permission for a replacement dwelling on this site was refused by Trafford Council on 14th July 2021 under application ref. 104103/FUL/21. This decision was subsequently appealed by the applicant (under appeal ref. APP/Q4245/W/21/3282485) and the appeal was dismissed on 17th January 2022 on heritage grounds, notably the effect of the development on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. As set out in Section 4, the design of the revised development proposal seeks to directly address the reasons for refusal highlighted in the appeal decision.

Text: Contents 2.0 Planning Policy Context

Text: Contents 2.1 As set out in Section 1, 1 Bow Green Road is located within the boundary of the Bowdon Conservation Area. Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 establishes “with respect to any buildings or other land within a conservation area… special attention must be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of that area.”

Text: Contents Relevant National Planning Policy and Guidance

Text: Contents 2.2 The NPPF was revised in July 2021 and overwrites all previous national planning policy. It establishes that the purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development by pursuing three interdependent objectives, which are economic, social and environmental. It is considered that the historic environment poses implications and opportunities for the achievement of sustainable development in relation to all three objectives.

Text: Contents 2.3 Section 16 of the NPPF relates specifically to ‘conserving and enhancing the historic environment.’ Paragraph 189 establishes that heritage assets are “an irreplaceable resource and should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance, so they can be enjoyed for their contribution to the quality of life of existing and future generations.”

Text: Contents 2.4 NPPF Paragraph 194 requires applicants to the describe the significance of any heritage assets affected by a proposed development, including any contribution made by their setting. It clarifies that the level of detail should be “proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance. As a minimum the relevant historic environment record should have been consulted and the heritage assets assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary.”

Text: Contents 2.5 The NPPF defines heritage ‘significance’ as “the value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”

Text: Contents 2.6 The ‘setting of a heritage asset’ is defined in the NPPF as “the surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral.”

Text: Contents 2.7 The NPPF does not have a definition for archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic interest with respect to heritage significance. However, Paragraph 16 of the Principles for Selection of Listed Buildings (DDCMS 2018) provides the following definitions:

Text: Contents Architectural interest – “to be of special architectural interest a building must be of importance in its design, decoration or craftsmanship. Special interest may also apply to particularly significant examples of building types or techniques… and significant plan forms. For more recent buildings in particular, the functioning of the building… will also be a consideration. Artistic distinction can also be a factor relevant to the architectural interest of buildings and objects and structures fixed to them.”

Text: Contents Historic interest – “to be able to justify special historic interest a building must illustrate important aspects of the nation’s history and/or have closely substantiated historical associations with nationally important individuals, groups or events; and the building itself in its current form will afford a strong connection with the valued aspect of history.”

Text: Contents 3

Text: Contents 2.8 Historic England’s Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance (2008) also offers useful definitions which underpin a value-orientated approach to assessing heritage significance. In this document, heritage values fall into four categories, which are broadly comparable with those expressed in the NPPF:

Text: Contents Evidential value – The potential of a place to yield evidence about past human activity.

Text: Contents Historical value – The ways in which past people, events and aspects of life can be connected through a place to the present. This can be illustrative or associative.

Text: Contents Aesthetic value – The ways in which people draw sensory and intellectual stimulation from a place.

Text: Contents Communal value – The meaning of a place for the people who relate to it or for whom it figures in their collective experience or memory.

Text: Contents 2.9

Text: Contents Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states “in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of:

Text: Contents a) The desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;

Text: Contents b) The positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and

Text: Contents c) The desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.”

Text: Contents 2.10 NPPF Paragraph 199 relates to development proposals affecting designated heritage assets such as conservation areas. It states “when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.”

Text: Contents 2.11 NPPF Paragraph 200 states “any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification.”

Text: Contents 2.12 NPPF Paragraph 201 establishes that “where a development will lead to substantial harm (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent, unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:

Text: Contents a) The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and b) No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and

Text: Contents c) Conservation by grant funding or some form of not-for-profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and

Text: Contents d) The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefits of bringing the site back into use.”

Text: Contents 2.13 NPPF Paragraph 202 states “where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.”

Text: Contents 2.14 NPPF Paragraph 206 establishes that “local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas, world heritage sites and within the setting of heritage assets, to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.”

Text: Contents Local Planning Policy

Text: Contents 2.15 Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires planning applications to be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

Text: Contents 2.16 The statutory development plan for Trafford currently consists of the Core Strategy (2012), the revised Unitary Development Plan (2006), Greater Manchester Joint Waste Plan (2012), Greater Manchester Joint Minerals Plan (2013) and made Neighbourhood Plans. Trafford Council are also in the process of preparing a new Local Plan for the borough, which will eventually become the main land-use planning document and will supersede the adopted Local Plan and Unitary Development Plan. Representations have been made on the draft Local Plan and a publication version is anticipated in Summer 2022 for examination by the Planning Inspectorate. As the process remains at a relatively early stage, the policies contained within the draft Local Plan can only be given limited weight.

Text: Contents 2.17 The Core Strategy was adopted in January 2012 and provides an overall spatial strategy for the local development framework, as well as strategic objectives and policies to guide and assess individual proposals for new development within the borough.

Text: Contents 2.18 Strategic Objective SO8 of the Core Strategy is to ‘protect the historic built environment’, requiring the Council to “protect, enhance and value the borough’s heritage to contribute to the attractiveness and distinctiveness of the borough.”

Text: Contents 2.19 Altringham and the neighbouring communities, including Bowdon, is also served by a more targeted set of ‘place objectives’. This includes Place Objective ALO3, “to protect and enhance the historic character, landscape and amenity of the area providing new units in keeping with this”, and Place Objective ALO29, “to protect and enhance the character of the environment, landscape, skylines and historic features especially in the Conservation Areas.”

Text: Contents 2.20 Core Strategy Policy L7 relates to design, particularly matters of design quality, functionality, protecting amenity, security and accessibility. It states “development must be appropriate in its context, make best use of opportunities to improve the character and quality of an area, enhance the street scene or character of the area by appropriately addressing scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevation treatment, materials, hard and soft landscaping works, boundary treatment and make appropriate provision for open space, where appropriate”.

Text: Contents 2.21 Core Strategy Policy R1 relates to the historic environment. It requires all new development to “take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness”. It also requires developers to “demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.”

Text: Contents 2.22 The Unitary Development Plan (‘RUDP’) was adopted in June 2006, with some policies being ‘saved’ in 2007 and 2008. The purpose of the RUDP is to provide the framework and priorities for development, improvement and conservation of land within the borough.

Text: Contents 2.23 RUDP Policy ENV2 identifies areas where specific efforts will be made to explore opportunities to improve the environment, including within conservation areas.

Text: Contents 2.24 RUDP Policy ENV6 relates to areas for conservation. It states “the Council will seek to protect and enhance identified areas of architectural, archaeological, cultural and heritage value.”

Text: Contents 5

Text: Contents 2.25 RUDP Policy ENV21 relates to conservation areas. It states “in determining applications for planning permission within Conservation Areas the Council will pay particular attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the area and will judge the effect of proposals by taking particular account of those special qualities identified in the pre-designation assessments. All developments within Conservation Areas will be expected to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the area. In determining applications for Conservation Area consent for demolition the Council will take account of the contribution made by the building to the character, appearance or special architectural interest of the area as a whole, including the merits of any proposed (re) development.”

Text: Contents 2.26 RUDP Policy ENV23 is concerned with development in conservation areas. It states “development proposals should preserve and enhance the character of Conservation Areas. They should be of the highest standard of design. They will be considered against the following criteria: -

Text: Contents a) In terms of its architectural design, siting, scale, proportions, emphasis, form, height and materials the development should be compatible with the character and setting of the Area and should relate to street and building patterns;

Text: Contents b) The treatment of associated landscaping, boundaries, paving, open spaces and associated street furniture, lighting and advertisement signs should be similarly complementary;

Text: Contents c) Any new or extended building should provide or retain sufficient space at the sides, front and rear to be in character with the surrounding area;

Text: Contents d) The hard area covered by buildings (including outbuildings and garages) and hard surfacing for parking and manoeuvring should not exceed that appropriate to the character of the surrounding area;

Text: Contents Important trees, boundary walls and gateposts should be retained;

Text: Contents f) Extensions and other external alterations (including shop fronts) should not result in the loss of significant architectural features and should be appropriate to the design of the building.”

Text: Contents 2.27 Bowdon is not contained within the area of a made Neighbourhood Plan. The Bowdon Conservation Area, however, was designated in 1973 and an appraisal document was adopted as supplementary planning guidance in July 2016. The aim of the Bowdon Conservation Area Appraisal (‘BCAA’) is to define and record the special architectural and historic interest of the Conservation Area, in order to support its active management through the development management process, including support for appeals. Full details of the BCAA and its relevance to the application are contained in Section 3 of this report.

Text: Contents 3.0 Assessment of Significance

Text: Contents 3.1 This section seeks to describe the significance of the application site as part of the Bowdon Conservation Area, with a view to understanding the potential impact of the proposed development in accordance with NPPF Paragraph 194, Core Strategy Policy R1 and RUDP Policy ENV21.

Text: Contents 3.2 An overview of the historical development of the application site and its environs is provided as context to a discussion of the site’s contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Contents Historical Context

Text: Contents 3.3 The settlement of Bowdon has Anglo Saxon origins and was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 as ‘Bogedon’, a small hamlet consisting of three households with a mill and church. There are also a few archaeological findspots within the settlement which point to early medieval occupation, including two pieces of sculpture recovered at St Mary’s Church and a silver coin.

Text: Contents 3.4 The expansion of the settlement during the medieval period was centred around the church and this area remains the historic core of Bowdon in the present day, although the area is now characterised by a number of pre-Victorian cottages and farmsteads and evidence of the medieval settlement is limited to the narrow plot strips, as well as ridge and furrow.

Text: Contents 3.5 During the later medieval and post-medieval periods, the land within the Bowdon Conservation Area remained agricultural in nature and was characterised by farmsteads, with the concentration of the settlement remaining around the church with its open square and the C17 Bowdon Hall on Langham Road. During this period, the number of farms and the size of the farmsteads steadily increased, as reflected in Burdett’s 1777 map of Cheshire, which shows two concentrations of settlement in the Bowdon area (Plate 2).

Text: Contents Plate 2 – Extract from P. P. Burdett’s map of Cheshire, 1777.

Text: Contents 3.6 The fastest and most significant period of growth of the settlement of Bowdon occurred in the mid-19th century, accelerated by the arrival of the commuter railway at Altrincham in 1849 and its extension to Hale in 1862. The extent of the settlement by the end of the 19th century is reflected in the 1898 OS map (Plate 3), by which time the eastern and western boundaries of the application site had been defined and the site contained part of a range of outbuildings to the rear of Vale Farmhouse (since demolished). The 1989 map also reflects the construction of houses to the north of Bow Green Road in the later 19th and 20th centuries, including Nos. 2-4 and 6-8 (evens), as well as No. 10.

Text: Contents 7

Text: Contents Plate 3 – Extract from OS County Series Map of Cheshire, 1898, 25 inches to the mile, showing location of application site (red) within the Conservation Area boundary (blue).

Text: Contents 3.7 The exact date in which the outbuildings to the rear of Vale Farmhouse were demolished is not known, although it must post-date the survey of the 1964 OS map. The existing dwelling – 1 Bow Green Road – is believed to have been constructed following the demolition of these buildings, in the 1960s or 70s. Gaddum Road, which connects to Bow Green Road to the immediate west of the application site, is believed to have been laid out at around the same time and the dwellings on this road are broadly contemporary with 1 Bow Green Road but fall outside of the Conservation Area boundary.

Text: Contents Bowdon Conservation Area – Character Zone 2: ‘Historic Core’

Text: Contents 3.8 The Bowdon Conservation Area is large and varied, with a medieval village core but also areas of post-medieval and Victorian ‘suburban’ expansion, as well as later infill. The Conservation Area is largely residential in character but also includes a number of larger detached community buildings, usually surrounded by open space in the central area. Within the residential areas, again, there is variety, including C17 cottages and farmhouses, C19 terraced housing, as well as spacious Victorian semi-detached houses and villas, with subsequent C20 and C21 infill and redevelopment.

Text: Contents 3.9 The application site is located within Character Zone 2, defined in the BCAA as the ‘historic core’. This zone comprises Church Brow, the south side of Langham Road from Church Brow to Vicarage Lane and those on the north west of the churchyard, the top of Talbot Road and Bow Green Road, Vale Road and the west side of Apsley Grove (Plate 4). It is defined as a predominantly residential area “characterised by the large number of pre-Victorian cottages and farmsteads and relatively small plot sizes, with the

Text: Contents Plate 4 – Aerial view of Bowdon, showing Character Zone 2 of the Bowden Conservation Area.

Text: Contents 8

Text: Contents historic strip plots still visible. Many of these houses have little or no front garden. There are also a considerable number of Victorian houses built in red or white brick on a modest scale, some with stone walls and gateposts.”

Text: Contents 3.10 The area immediately surrounding the application site is more spacious in character than this description suggests, both as a result of individual plot sizes and layout, as well as the two areas of open space sited at the junctions of Bow Green Road with Langham Road (Plate 5) and Gaddum Road (Plate 6). The 2022 appeal decision describes how the corner property of 2 Gaddum Road, “in combination with the space to the west of the dwelling on the appeal site, creates a strong sense of spaciousness around the junction.” This spacious quality contributes positively to the character of the Conservation Area and is an important feature of views available when entering the Conservation Area from the southwest along Bow Green Road (Plate 7).

Text: Contents 3.11 The dwellings to the northwest of the application site – Nos. 2-4, 6-8 and 10 Bow Green Road – are identified as ‘positive contributors’ to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area in the BCAA. Nos. 2-4 and 6-8 (Plate 8) comprise four mid-C19 semi- detached properties built in brick with attractive brick detailing. The dwellings are set back from Bow Green Road behind short front gardens and a boundary wall and hedge but nevertheless make a strong contribution to the character of this part of the Conservation Area. No. 10 is a large, early to mid-C20 detached dwelling built in brick with simple proportions and detailing. It is set further back from the road than Nos. 2-8 and as a result is less visually prominent in the streetscene.

Text: Contents Left Plate 8 – View of Nos. 2-4 and 6-8 Bow Green Road from south on Gaddum Road.

Text: Contents Right Plate 9 – View of 10 Bow Green Road from north on Bow Green Road.

Text: Contents 3.12 The application site is located on the opposite side of Bow Green Road to these positive contributors and can be considered to form part of their respective settings. Nos. 2-4 in particular are almost directly opposite No. 1 (Plate 9) and the buildings share a close visual relationship, framing the north-facing view into the Conservation Area and towards St Mary’s Churchyard. As highlighted in the appeal decision, 1 Bow Green Road is a modern, two storey detached dwelling “of limited architectural interest… [and] due to its simple form, the existing dwelling makes a neutral contribution to the character and appearance of the area.”

Text: Contents 3.13 The plot in which the dwelling is situated is unusually large for Character Zone 2 and is mostly open and grassed (Plate 10). The western boundary of the site is treated with a tall, dense hedge which screens views towards the dwelling from Gaddum Road (Plate 11). The hedge gives way to a lower timber lap fence with concrete posts and brick piers on the site’s northern boundary, which facilitates views into the site from along Bow Green Road. There are also trees located both within and outside of the application site boundary (at the junction between Bow Green Road and Gaddum Road), which contribute positively to the verdant character of this part of the Conservation Area and partially screen views into the site (see Plates 6 and 7).

Text: Contents 3.14 In summary, the existing dwelling within the site is modern and of little architectural or historic interest, although its modest and restrained character means that it makes a neutral contribution to the Conservation Area and the setting of identified positive contributors, particularly 2-4 Bow Green Road. The residential plot is larger than most in the Character Area and is characterised by its openness, which reinforces the spacious character of this part of the Conservation Area centred on the junction between Bow Green Road and Gaddum Road. This spacious quality reveals itself primarily in views which are available upon entering the Conservation Area from the southwest along Bow Green Road, as well as views from other locations including Langham Road (see Plate 5) and Gaddum Road (see Plate 11).

Text: Contents 4.0 Proposed Development

Text: Contents 4.1 The proposed development involves the demolition and replacement of the existing dwelling and adjoining garage with a new dwelling and detached garage. Full details of the proposed development are contained in the Design & Access Statement provided in support of the application.

Text: Contents 4.2 The design of the proposed development has evolved with my input from an early stage and in particular seeks to address issues raised in the appeal decision in order to deliver a scheme which capitalises on the opportunities of the site and genuinely enhances the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Contents 4.3 The design of the proposed replacement dwelling draws on materials, form, features and detailing which is represented in this part of the Conservation Area while adopting an overall contemporary approach which is honest and ‘of its time’.

Text: Contents 4.4 The dwelling is to be split-level (up to 2.5 storeys) and recessed in stages to integrate with the natural gradient of the land within the site and reduce the perceived mass of the dwelling (Plate 12). The predominant building material will be Cheshire brick with Portland stone and aluminium-framed glazing beneath natural slate tiled roofs. The existing boundary fence is also proposed to be replaced and upgraded with a Cheshire brick boundary wall with stone cappings in front of a new hedge.

Text: Contents 5.0 Impact Assessment

Text: Contents 5.1 This section seeks to summarise the potential impacts of the proposed development on the significance of the Bowdon Conservation Area, before considering the development within the context of local and national planning policy relating to the conservation of the historic environment.

Text: Contents Impact on the Bowdon Conservation Area

Text: Contents 5.2 As set out in Section 3, the Bowdon Conservation Area is large and varied and its significance rests on a wide range of factors. The small scale of the proposed development, which involves the replacement of a single dwelling on a relatively small site, is such that the proposals are unlikely to have a substantial impact on the overall significance of the Conservation Area. Nevertheless, the proposals have the potential to affect the character or appearance of part of the Conservation Area and there is a statutory requirement for development to at least ‘preserve’ that character or appearance. The NPPF also places ‘great weight’ on the need to sustain the significance of designated heritage assets, including conservation areas (Para. 199).

Text: Contents 5.3 Within this context, the existing dwelling is a modest, plain building of the 1960s or 70s. While it is set back informally from Bow Green Road within a large, open plot, the house itself is of limited architectural interest and makes a neutral contribution to the character and appearance of this part of the Conservation Area. Its demolition was considered acceptable in principle in app ref. 104103/FUL/21 and in the resulting appeal, and presents an opportunity to redevelop the site in a manner which enhances its contribution to the Conservation Area. The proposed development aims to achieve this by introducing a new dwelling of high quality, contemporary design which draws on some of the materials, form, features and detailing represented in traditional properties in the immediate surrounding area.

Text: Contents 5.4 More specifically, the proposed dwelling will be formed of high-quality, traditional materials, including locally-sourced Cheshire brick, similar to that which is present in nearby 2-8 Bow Green Road and Rose Cottages (Plate 13), Portland Stone and natural slate tiles. This would improve upon the more uniform, modern bricks and concrete interlocking tiles present on the existing building. The proposals also incorporate slim- framed aluminium glazing, which while modern in character is more attractive than the existing ubiquitous upvc windows and doors.

Text: Contents Left Plate 13 – View of Rose Cottages (79 and 81 Langham Road) from east on Bow Green Road.

Text: Contents Right Plate 14 – View of Vale Bank (No. 65), Vale Mount (No. 63) and Nos. 55-61 (odds) Langham Road from north on Langham Road.

Text: Contents 5.5 Furthermore, the 2.5 storey scale and pitched roof form of the proposed dwelling is consistent with the scale and form of existing dwellings in the locality. The dwelling would

Text: Contents 13

Text: Contents incorporate features such as two storey bay windows, dormers and projecting gables, which are intended to be contemporary expressions of similar features on nearby traditional buildings, including 2-8 Bow Green Road (see Plate 8) and numerous properties along Langham Road (Plate 14). A round-headed window is also proposed within the principal gable in the north elevation, to mirror those of a similar profile at 2-8 Bow Green Road.

Text: Contents The increased “bulk and prominence” of the replacement dwelling as highlighted in the appeal decision was a key reason for the refusal of the previous application and the dismissal of the subsequent appeal. Consequently, the proposed development seeks to address this issue by recessing the new dwelling further into the site, having it step back in stages away from the road and also step down in height following the natural gradient of the land. This will limit the perceived mass of the building and ensure that it does not unduly affect identified positive views into the Conservation Area from the south. Plates 15 and 16 seek to illustrate the benefits of this approach in comparison with the previously refused scheme. Overall, while the proposed dwelling is undoubtedly larger than the existing, the plot is considered to be of sufficient size to accommodate this increase while retaining a good level of open space about the building, which is acknowledged to be a positive feature of this part of the Conservation Area.

Text: Contents Plate 16 – Visual comparison of existing dwelling (left) and proposed dwelling (right) in identified positive view into the Conservation Area along Bow Green Road.

Text: Contents 5.7 The proposals also include the retention of the existing substantial hedge to the western boundary of the site, as well as the replacement of the existing timber lap fence with a more traditional Cheshire brick wall and new hedge along the full length of the site’s northern boundary. This will not only enhance the appearance of the site frontage but will also provide robust screening for the proposed development, further to that which was previously proposed under application ref. 104103/FUL/21.

Text: Contents 14

Text: Contents 5.8 The proposed dwelling has been substantially reduced in scale and rearranged in a manner which minimises its perceived mass and potential visual impact. The materiality, form and style of the dwelling is of a higher quality than the existing and will add interest to the Conservation Area, while reinforcing characteristics that are already present in the positive traditional buildings in the immediate context of the site. NPPF Paragraph 197 underlines the desirability of new development where it makes “a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness” and it is considered that the proposed development would achieve this for the reasons set out above.

Text: Contents 5.9 With respect to Core Strategy Policies L7 (Design) and R1 (Historic Environment), the proposed development has sought to capitalise on opportunities to improve the character of the area and enhance the streetscene, not only by taking design inspiration from nearby traditional buildings, but also in proposing to significantly enhance the public-facing boundaries of the site with a brick wall and hedge. As detailed above, the proposed dwelling is contemporary and ‘of its time’ but uses form, materials and features in a manner which references the character of identified positive contributors on Bow Green Road and Langham Road. This approach is considered to be acceptable in conservation terms and addresses the issues raised in response to the previous application.

Text: Contents 5.10 Overall, the proposed development has the potential to enhance the character and appearance of the Bowdon Conservation Area and will in turn enhance its significance as a designated heritage asset, in accordance with NPPF Paragraphs 189 and 197 of the NPPF, Core Strategy Policy R1 and RUDP Policy ENV21.

Text: Contents 6.0 Conclusions

Text: Contents 6.1 This Heritage Impact Assessment has been prepared on behalf of Mr Adam Fadle in support of a full planning application for the demolition of an existing dwelling and the erection of a replacement dwelling with associated hard and soft landscaping works at 1 Bow Green Road, Bowdon, Altrincham, WA14 3LZ.

Text: Contents 6.2 The application site contains no known heritage assets but is located within the boundary of the Bowdon Conservation Area and is considered to make a positive contribution to its character and appearance.

Text: Contents 6.3 The proposed development involves the demolition and replacement of the existing ‘neutral’ dwelling and adjoining garage with a new dwelling and detached garage. The proposed dwelling is contemporary in character and incorporates materials, details and features which reflect the local vernacular and identified positive buildings in the vicinity of the site.

Text: Contents 6.4 Overall, the proposed development has been found to have the potential to enhance the character and appearance of the Bowdon Conservation Area and will in turn enhance its significance as a designated heritage asset, in accordance with NPPF Paragraphs 189 and 197 of the NPPF, Core Strategy Policy R1 and RUDP Policy ENV21.

Text: Contents 6.5 The proposals therefore accord with local and national planning policy relating to the conservation of the historic environment and should therefore be approved without delay, subject to the satisfaction of other planning policy considerations.
