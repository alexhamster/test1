Text: Introduction 1 This publication has been prepared on behalf of the ILP Technical Committee for study and application. The document reports on current knowledge and experience within the specific fields of light and lighting described and is intended to be used by the ILP membership and other interested parties. It should be noted, however, that the status of this document is advisory and not mandatory. The ILP should be consulted regarding possible subsequent amendments. Any mention of organisations or products does not imply endorsement by the ILP. Whilst every care has been taken in th e compilation of any lists, up to th e time of going to press, these may not be comprehensive. Compliance with any recommendations does not itself confer immunity from legal obligations .

Text: Introduction 1 This document is intended to provide pragmatic quldance to all people involved with exterior illuminated advertisements. This document supersedes TR05: Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements published in 2001 and has been updated to reflect changes in lighting practice, technology and legal framework.

Text: Introduction 1 The scope of the guide is to cover installations of advertisements within the British Isles, however, the planning regulations vary from country to country and whilst the key requirements are given in Section 3.1 it is not possible in a document like this report to exhaustively cover every law applying to advertisements and signs in each in many sections of this guide the processes follow a template country. Moreover, derived from English planning regulations.

Text: Introduction 1 Illuminated signage and advertisements have become an integral part of our street scene and they are designed to have an impact. The aim of this document is to provide guidance on how to assess the impact of any additional signage. When considering any application for additional signage, thought should be given to how it is to be viewed within the street scene. One sign on its own may have a minimal impact on the street scene however many signs may have a negative impact on the street scene confusing the visual task or visual amenity.

Text: Media fa~ade A media facade is the envelope of a bulldlnq in which a number of light emitting components have been incorporated so that they are visible to people outside the building. These components may be able to change intensity and colour, and may be addressed individually and controlled together. If these components are sufficiently close together and are furnished with appropriate control such that they may be resolved by the human eye to display a recognisable image and/or alphanumeric text then the facade will be considered a media screen for the purposes of this gUidance.

Text: 3.1 Statutory regulations/ controls In this and subsequent sections the terms regulations and controls are used interchangeably as they have similar meanings. This section gives an overview of the regulations that impact on advertisements across the UK; however it does not address all aspects of the advertisement controls. Therefore this guidance must be used with caution and reference made to the regulations themselves.

Text: 3.1 Statutory regulations/ controls Statutory Requirements for Advertisements

Text: England England

Text: England The Town and Country Planning Act 1990' provides powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations 'restricting or regulating the display of advertisements so far as appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient in the interests of amenity or public safety'. This power is under sections 220-224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 .

Text: England The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 20072 have been in force since 6 April 2007. These Regulations revoked and rep laced the earlier versions issued in the 1990s. Section 336(i) of the T&P Act 1990 (as amended by section 24 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991') provides a comprehe nsive definition of the te rm advertisement (see above) of which there are 3 types. Firstly th ere are many advertisements which are outside any control. The Regulations automatically support a second group of advertisements as 'deemed consent' under Part 2. These advertisements do not requ ire the LPA's consent . This is subject to a compliance with specified 'Conditions and Limitations' which are explored below and include some illuminated signs. Thirdly where such advertisements

Text: England 1 et seq: SeeSection 11 References

Text: England 9

Text: England cannot be installed as 'deemed consent' these signs will require the 'express consent' of the LPA.

Text: England A wide range of advertisements featuring illumination can be displayed under 'deemed consent' including following Classes of Advertisement:

Text: England Functional Advertisements - Government, Local Authorities etc; Class 1:

Text: England Professional, Personal, Trade; Class 2B:

Text: England Miscellaneous Temporary Advertisements; Class 2C:

Text: England Illuminated Advertisements on Business Premises; Class 4A:

Text: England Advertisement Displayed after the Expiry of Express Consent. Class 14:

Text: England It is not feasible or within th e remit of this publication to refer to th e specified 'Constraints and Limitations' of each class. However, th ere are some common themes which control the illumination of advertisements under Classes 2B, 2C, 4A, 4B and 8. These include th e need to comply with 'd eemed consent' and therefore such advertisements do not require 'express consent'. The advertisements should comply with th e following features:

Text: England Static •

Text: England • No intermittent light sources, flashing lights, moving parts or features, exposed cold cathode tubing, animation or retroflective material

Text: England • Illumination in a manner reasonably required to fulfil the purpose of advertisem ent, and

Text: England Maximum permitted luminance levels are given in Table 1. •

Text: England Instituti on of Lighting Professionals

Text: England The calculation of luminance is based on 2 criteria:

Text: England • No unilluminated part of the advertisement is to be ta ken into account, and

Text: England in th e case of double-sided projecting • (or Each advertisement advertisements) each side of th e advertisement is to be taken into account separately.

Text: England For classes 4A and 4B for Illuminated Advertisement on Business premises there are additional controls:

Text: England Halo Il lumination, or •

Text: England 'So long as no part of • the back ground of the advertisement is illuminated, by illumination of each character or symbol of the advertisement from within'.

Text: England Areas of Special Control (ASC)

Text: England These restrict the type of advertisement which can be insta lled over the normal 'deemed consent' criteria. The 200 7 Regulations and those applicable to Wales and Scotland enable designa tion by a LPA with subsequent approval by the Secretary of State. These can be revoked or modified and require review every 5 years. Often ASC are in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or National Parks.

Text: England The 2007 Regulations preclude the installing of Classes 4A, 4B, 8, 13 and 14 and therefore illuminated advertisements without 'express consent'. This gives the LPA opportunities to consider whether it is appropriate to give consent to such advertisements in the interests of amenity and public safety. Due to the sensitive special requirements associated with ASC there may be robust amenity reasons why such illuminated signage should be restricted. In Scotland there is no opportunity to display such signs whatsoever.

The approach to advertisement control has common ground with the 2007 Regulations relevant to England. However, there are some differences, including luminance levels and no parallel to Advertisement Class 4A which covers illuminated advertisements for 'Retail Parks'. The regulations are complimented by Circulars 10/1984, 22/1986, 10/1992 and 31/1992.

Text: Standard Conditions and Maintenance The Regulations in England also provide conditions of installation that impose conditions upon the installation requiring maintenance throughout its life.

Text: Standard Conditions and Maintenance With the exception of one type of advertisement all that are displayed are required to comply by five Standard Conditions of the Regulations. Those that directly relate to maintenance are:

Text: Condition 2 Condition 2

Text: Condition 2 No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to

Text: Condition 4 Where an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the site shall be left in a condition that does not endanger the public or impair visual amenity.

Text: Condition 4 The display of an advertisement which fails to comply with any of the Standard Conditions will be unauthorised under the Regulations. This is because it is an offence 'to display an advertisement in contravention of the Regulations' and can result in a prosecution by a LPA.

The LPA's assessment may include very sensitive environments such as conservation areas, the setting of listed buildings, ancient monuments, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and national parks. It is common for these to coincide with designated ASCs which preclude the display of some advertisements normally allowed under 'deemed consent'.

Text: Brightness and luminance Brightness and luminance

Text: Brightness and luminance The fundamental relationship on which the recommendations contained within this report are based, is that between luminance and brightness.

Text: Brightness and luminance Luminance is a characteristic of the sign, dependent on the position of the observer, but independent of th e surrounding conditions. Generally a sign face is non uniform and the luminance will vary across it. The luminance will also vary with the direction of viewing, being a maximum for direct frontal observation. The highly diffusing plastic materials normally used in signs result in the luminance remaining near the maximum over a fairly wide range of viewing angles, falling off steeply for very oblique viewing.

Text: Brightness and luminance Brightness is the visual sensation associated with luminance, experienced by an observer. It depends on four main factors:

Text: Brightness and luminance a) luminance

Text: Brightness and luminance b) size

Text: Brightness and luminance c) contrast

Text: Brightness and luminance d) the observer

Text: Brightness and luminance In addition, other factors, which may affect brightness, are the position of the sign with respect to the observer's field of view, particularly when it appears on the periphery; the effect of phototropism, and the uniformity of luminance across the sign face.

Text: Brightness and luminance The difficulties associated with the problem of sign luminance may be appreciated by considering two identical signs in different settings. If one is placed in a well lit shopping area it will appear to be considerably less bright than its counterpart in a dark country lane. The one may be attractive and th e other offensive, although the signs themselves are identical. The luminance is the same for both signs but the

Text: Brightness and luminance 16

Text: Brightness and luminance Institution of Lighting Professionals

Text: Brightness and luminance contrast between the sign and its surroundings and therefore the brightness is quite different.

Text: Brightness and luminance The LPA is concerned primarily with brightness, whilst the manufacturer is able to control lum inance only. It is possible to set upper limits of luminance for defined types of location and graded size of sign, such that compliance with them will minimise the number of illuminated advertisements that are subjectively too bright yet will permit them to be adequately bright for their purpose.

Text: Brightness and luminance During the preparation of this report many observations and measurements have been taken of illuminated advertisements in a variety of locations including Central London, provinclal cities, suburban areas, mixed residential and shopping areas, retail parks, pedestrian precincts and areas of special historical and architectural interest. The measured luminance has been related to acceptable degrees of subjective brightness for many sizes of illuminated advertisements in Widely different environments.

Text: Brightness and luminance The measurements taken on signs and fascias cover maximum luminance and average luminance. There is always some variation of luminance over a sign and the average, even after several measurements have been made, can only be estimated approxlrnatelv. Therefore the recommendations within this report deal with limits on the maximum luminance of a sign . This has the advantage that:

Text: Brightness and luminance a) Where, as often happens, the brightest area can be selected by eye, only one measurement is required and the maximum is a definite figure.

Text: Brightness and luminance Signs with large variations of brightness are more likely to infringe b) limits imposed upon the maximum luminance than upon the average.

Text: Brightness and luminance The uniformity of luminance across a defined illuminated area must be kept within reasonable limits so as to ensure a pleasing and effective result (see section 8). It may be of help to designers and manufacturers of signs to consider the luminance gradient of illuminated advertisement signs . A method for testing both luminance and luminance gradient is

Text: Brightness and luminance described in Section 9.

Text: Brightness and luminance In setting upper limits for the luminance of signs it is important to take account of the considerable reduction in brightness which may occur during the life of the installati on. The overriding consideration must be that it should not present a hazard when the lighting is

Text: Brightness and luminance Internally illuminated sign with good uniformity

Text: Brightness and luminance :

Text: Brightness and luminance Institution of Lighting Professionals

Text: Brightness and luminance 17

Text: Brightness and luminance commissioned. In practice, design calculations would normally be set at a datum point of 100 hours after the initial light source lumen output, and therefore measurements should not be taken before the light sources have been in commission for 100 hours. In practice, it is considered that installations are likely to have a luminance between 50% and 80% of the initial value for a major part of their life, depending on maintenance.

Text: Brightness and luminance Large format media screens pose additional problems when trying to assess brightness, this is because the luminance of the sign varies with both time and position on the sign. For this reason it is recommended that the sign be set to a full output white when it is being measured to ensure that the maximum luminance of the sign is measured.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements In all cases the limit of luminance should be determined by relating the details of the installation to Table 4 of this report, ta king into account its method of illumination, size, location, and orientation.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements Consideration should be made to introducing a system of control that imposes a limit on the maximum luminance and time of operation of an advertisement. Any system of control must be easy to und erstand, interpret, apply and enforce within the present Regulations. It is essential that any luminance limits specified should have regard to amenity and public safety. At the same ti me, account must be ta ken of the amenities to which good illuminated advertisement installations contribute and of th e commercial interests involved.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements The limit of luminance to be imposed as a condition of consent should be determined by relating the details of the appl ication to Table 4 of this Report.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements The recommended limits of luminance also apply to externally illuminated advertisements and such lighting should be examined to ensure that luminaires are positioned such that the light source itself is not directly visible from any usual viewing angle (e.g. to road users or residents).

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements The ILP has produced Guidance Notes for the Reduction of Light Pollution and the general principles contained therein are worthy of consideration for all lighting installations. In particular the Guidance Notes detail a number of ways which may be used to reduce the problems of unnecessary, obtrusive light:

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements a) Switch off illumination when not required - one possible solution is a curfew with further limitations on lighting levels between agreed hours (e.g. off between 23.00hr and dawn).

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements b) For signs with external illumination direct light downwards whenever possible. If there is no alternative to up-lighting , then the use of shields and baffles to help reduce light spill. Use specifically designed lighting equipment that once installed minimises the spread of light near to, or above the horizontal.

Text: 8 Recommendations 1. For digital signs when the content may change then the rate of change should be limited to once every five seconds. Moving images, animation, video or full motion images should not be displayed at locations where they could present a hazard for example if they could be seen by drivers in moving traffic. During the daytime sign luminance should never exceed 5,000cdm-2.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The maximum recommend ed levels of luminance contai ned within this report are intended to be used in order to satisfy the requ irements of all parties and on the basis of sound engineering judgement and amenity considerations. It may be necessary to include other areas within particular zones, such as areas of particular architectural interest within zone El, so as to ensure th at and historical th e illuminati on of advertisements is in keeping not only with its purpose, but also with the environment. Such an example would be a Dark Landscape Park within an otherwise Zone E3 or E4 location.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The checking of luminance levels to ensure compliance with th e Advertisement Consent, or for the purposes of measurements in those cases when dispute or doubt arises, requires the use of a suitable reliable instrument capable of direct measurement. It is possible that the local authority's lighti ng engin eer will already possess a suitable instrument, but if this is not th e case it is recommended that one should be acquired for the express purpose of obtaining luminance measurements of illuminated advertisements. It is recommended that any luminance meter used should comp ly with the requirements for a Type F meter as defined by as 7920:2005 Luminance meters. Requirements and test methods.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Whenever a performance measurement is carried out there are a number of factors that may impact upon the performance of the lighting installation being tested. There are a number of issues associated with the lighting equipment and others that relate to the environment.

Text: 9 Testing and verification It is important to ensure that the output of the lamps is stable. In general this requires that they have been run for at least 100 hours and they have had time to run up a reach thermal stability, which may take half an hour or so. Also if the lamps have been in use for a long time then their output may be lower than the nominal output. Similarly if the sign has been running for a long time the build up of dirt on the surfaces may be reducing the light output. Many lamp types are sensitive to changes in temperature so it is important to record the temperature when taking readings. The supply voltage can significantly change the output of some lamps so it is a good idea to measure the supply voltage. As there can be a voltage drop in the supply cabling it is best to measure the voltage in the supply network as close to the luminaires as possible.

Text: 9 Testing and verification For media screens it is necessary to set the whole sign to display white as this is the colour with the highest luminance.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Signs using exposed light sources (e.g. cold cathode tubing) should be measured at right angles to the sign at a distance such that the shortest dimension of the lit area fills a diameter of the viewing circle.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Internally illuminated signs would usually have the maximum value of luminance in the white portion; coloured portions would generally have a luminance value of between 0.02 and 0.80 of the value of the white portion, assuming a uniform illumination and depending on the colour and transmission characteristics of the coloured portions.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Readings should be taken only at night to avoid any contribution from daylight and care should be taken to avoid any misleading readings, such as might be caused by or from other light sources in the measurement field of a luminance meter.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The number of points to measure on is a function of the size of the sign. It is normal to measure the luminance on a regular grid of points with the maximum distance between the points (p) being given by the formula below where d is the distance of p=0.2x5Iogd

Text: 9 Testing and verification the longest side of the sign. The number of polnts in this dimension should be selected so that the distance between them is p or slightly less. Then in the other direction select the number of points necessary to give a similar distance between points thus giving an almost square grid. Table 5, below, gives information on the spacing of measurement points for a range of sign sizes. The points are laid out uniformly across the whole sign with the edge points being a half spacing in from the edge of the sign.

Text: 10 Maintenance There are examples of poorly maintained illuminated advertisements in most areas resulting in, at best, a non-uniform unpleasant appearance and at worst the exposing of the light sources.

Text: 10 Maintenance For any signage to deliver best value, it needs to be maintained throughout its life, although there is no duty to ensure that the illumination is operational unless this is a requirement of the original consent. However, if it is, it should be maintained to ensure that it operates within the design parameters, delivering the expected design performance (illumination and uniformity) throughout the installations life, in accordance with original consent, ensuring that public safety is assured.

Text: 10 Maintenance With advances in technologies the sign design should consider the use of low energy, low maintenance solutions and perhaps with advanced control to ensure that the sign can be adapted in the future. By applying th is approach the installation can optimise maintenance obligations and manage energy use responsibly, thereby reducing the carbon impact of the installation.
