Text: Detailed Section The proposal is accompanied by a full Heritage Impact Assessment prepared by ID Planning. The conclusions are below.

Text: Detailed Section The application site contains no known heritage assets but is located within the boundary of the Bowdon Conservation Area and is considered to make a positive contribution to its character and appearance.

Text: Detailed Section The proposed development involves the demolition and replacement of the existing ‘neutral’ dwelling and adjoining garage with a new dwelling and detached garage. The proposed dwelling is contemporary in character and incorporates materials, details and features which reflect the local vernacular and identified positive buildings in the vicinity of the site.

Text: Detailed Section Overall, the proposed development has been found to have the potential to enhance the character and appearance of the Bowdon Conservation Area and will in turn enhance its significance as a designated heritage asset, in accordance with NPPF Paragraphs 189 and 197 of the NPPF, Core Strategy Policy R1 and RUDP Policy ENV21.

Text: Detailed Section The proposals therefore accord with local and national planning policy relating to the conservation of the historic environment and should therefore be approved without delay, subject to the satisfaction of other planning policy

Text: Detailed Section considerations.

Text: Detailed Section 14

Text: Detailed Section Our clients intention is to implement sustainable strategies wherever practical. This document outlines some of the broad principles being adopted as part of this development

Text: Detailed Section Energy efficient and eco friendly lighting which significantly reduces carbon footprint of a dwelling.

Text: Detailed Section Air and ground source heat pumps absorb heat from the outside air or ground and convert this into usable heat for both space heating and water heating

Text: Detailed Section Timber is a renewable construction material with low levels of embodied energy if sourced correctly, timber truss roofs use less timber than traditional roof construction so are therefore even more sustainable.

Text: Detailed Section High thermal performance insulation is to be used to achieve a performance better than building regulations where practical. This will reduce the need for heating and make the home more energy efficient.

Text: Detailed Section To reduce water consumption, water saving appliances will be used

Text: Detailed Section High performance low E glazing will be installed throughout which will reduce heat loss in winter and control solar gain during the warmer months
