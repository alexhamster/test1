Text: 1 Introduction 1.1.2 The proposals would provide a mixed-use development comprising leisure/retail units with offices above. The leisure/retail floor units would be accessed off Central Way and would be located on the lower ground and ground floors. The shops, which are existing, are on the ground floor and front onto George Street which forms the eastern boundary of the site. The offices would be located on the upper floors of the building and would be accessed via a lane running between Central Way and George Street.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 1.1.3 This Framework Travel Plan (FTP) is an accompanying document to the planning application and has been produced to set out key parameters that relate to implementation of the full Travel Plan (TP) that will be in place once the development is occupied. The full TP will promote a series of targeted measures that will aim to encourage visitors to the site to use sustainable travel instead of making single-occupancy car trips.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 1.1.4 Agreement is sought on the parameters of the Full Travel Plan with the Local Planning Authority (LPA) and Local Highway Authority (LHA) which is Trafford Council (TC).

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1 Background to Travel Plans

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.1 A TP is a package of practical measures that aims to reducing the traffic impacts of a development. The main objective of a TP is usually to reduce single occupancy car trips whilst simultaneously encouraging travel via sustainable modes of transport.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.2 The DfT’s document ‘Making Residential Travel Plans Work’ (June 2007) introduces the concept of a ‘Travel Plan Pyramid’. This helps demonstrate how successful plans are built on the firm foundations of a good location and site design. The pyramid is presented in Figure 2.1.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context Figure

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context Source: Making Residential Travel Plans Work, Department for Transport, 2007

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.3 The use of a pyramid structure to illustrate the 5-tier hierarchy of measures demonstrates the concept that each higher layer builds upon the more important foundations of criteria and initiatives below it.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.4 The most important layer of the pyramid is considered to be the base, which shows the key to making TPs work is the actual location of the development and its proximity to local facilities and services.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context 2.1.5

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context In terms of location, the site is within Altrincham town centre and so is close to a wide range of local amenities and facilitates. It is also within walking and cycling distance of residential areas which makes it feasible for visitors and staff to travel to the site via of foot and by bike.

Text: 2 Travel Plan Context www.eggtransport.co.uk

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk www.eggtransport.co.uk

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk page 3

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.6 The second layer of the pyramid refers to how the layout of the site can assist in reducing the need to travel, which in this instance is again linked to the existing layout which includes cycle parking. Additionally, the proximity of bus routes, the Metrolink, rail connections and local pedestrian and cycle infrastructure provides access to a range of key amenities and employment destinations.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.7 As indicated in Level 3 of the pyramid, the Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC) will be able to develop further measures to maximise the sustainable travel at the development.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.8 Level 4 of the pyramid looks at how parking management and public transport can influence travel choice.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.9 The top layer of the pyramid relates to how the TP will be marketed and how the measures within are to be promoted.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.1.10 Future users of the proposed development will be made aware of the aims of the TP and will be informed of sustainable travel choices that are available. Additionally, public transport information will be displayed in any reception areas, where appropriate.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.2 Objectives of the Plan

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.2.1 The key objectives of this TP are to:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • minimise single occupancy car trips;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • promote car sharing, walking, cycling and public transport as safe, efficient, affordable alternatives to private car; and

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • highlight the health and environmental benefits of using sustainable travel modes.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.3 Benefits of the Plan

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.3.1 A large number of benefits could be derived from the successful implementation of the TP, for future visitors to the site as well as the wider community. These include:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk improved health and fitness through increased levels of walking and cycling;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk increased flexibility offered through wider travel choices;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk the social aspects of sharing transport with others; and

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • improvements to the environment surrounding the site as vehicular movements are minimised and parking pressures are reduced.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4 Targets

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.1 Targets are the measurable goals by which the progress of the TP would be assessed. Targets are essential for monitoring the progress and success of the TP, and should be ‘SMART’ – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-related.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.2 Targets come in two forms. ‘Action’ type targets are non-quantifiable actions that need to be achieved by a certain time, while ‘Aim’ type targets are quantifiable and generally relate to the degree of modal shift the TP is seeking to achieve.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.3 Action targets include actions such as appointing a TPC, and launching the TP.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.4 The ‘aim’ targets contained in the TP focus on minimising the proportion of trips made to and from the site by single occupancy vehicles while encouraging the use of sustainable travel modes.

Text: 2.4 Targets 2.4.5 The TP targets should therefore aim to achieve a realistic and feasible reduction in car driver trips over the first 5 years from when the development is occupied, with a full review scheduled 5 years thereafter.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5 Initial Travel Research

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.1

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research In order to set targets to reduce the reliance on private car travel and increase the use of sustainable modes, the travel behaviour of visitors to the site at the start of the TP will be collected once the site is fully occupied.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.2 Without this initial baseline data, the modal split of the workplace population has been forecast using census dataset (WP703EW - Method of travel to work (Workplace population) for the census area ‘Trafford 025’ in which the development is situated. The modal split of people who work in this area is shown in Table 2.1.

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research Table 2.1 – Modal Split of Commuting Trips

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research Mode Modal Split Public Transport 16% Car Driver or Motorcycle 64% Car Passenger or Taxi 6% Bicycle 3% On Foot 11% Total 100%

Text: 2.5 Initial Travel Research 2.5.3 The census data presented in Table 2.1 gives an initial indication of commuting patterns at the site prior to the initial travel surveys being carried out and without the influence of TP measures. It shows that 36% or people working in the area around the site use sustainable travel modes such as public transport, cycling, walking or car sharing.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.5 The figures in Table 2.2 are indicative only and would be considered fully when travel surveys have been undertaken.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk have been undertaken.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.6 Once the site is fully occupied, employees would be surveyed, and targets produced. Once the development is occupied, sustainable travel initiatives (such as those described in section 4) would be implemented.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 2.5.7 It would take time for the effects of the possible initiatives to occur. During the time between the initial survey and the second survey, sufficient time should have passed for a shift in travel patterns to occur.

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.1 Introduction

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.1.1 This section of the report examines the accessibility of the site by sustainable travel modes and considers the following:

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity • Walking and Cycling

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity • Public Transport

Text: 3 Sustainable Connectivity 3.2 Walking and Cycling

Text: Walking Walking

Text: Walking 3.2.1 The Institute for Highways and Transportation (IHT) publication ‘Guidelines for Providing for Journeys on Foot’ (2000) provides suggested walking distances to some common facilities, which may be used for development planning purposes. The document recognises that the preferred maximum walking distance for commuting trips is 2km.

Text: Walking 3.2.2 This document goes on to state that “walking accounts for over a quarter of all journeys and four fifths of journeys of less than one mile” (Paragraph 1.12, Page 11). In other words, around 80% of trips of less than 1 mile are made on foot.

Text: Walking 3.2.3 The site is located within Altrincham town centre but benefits from also being close to significant residential areas with very good pedestrian facilities. It is possible to walk to the site from most of Altrincham as well as from parts of neighbouring areas such as Timperley, Hale and Bowden.

Text: Cycling Cycling

Text: Cycling 3.2.4

Text: Cycling It is generally accepted that cycling has the greatest potential to substitute for short car trips, particularly those less than 5km. A large amount of residential development is located within 5km of the site which means that staff and visitors to the development could cycle to the site.

Text: Cycling 3.2.5 A 5km cycle distance from the site includes all of Altrincham, Hale, Timperley, Hale Barns and parts of Sale. The topography of the area is fairly flat and there is a vast network of lightly trafficked residential streets in the surrounding environment, most of which are subject to a 30mph speed limit which makes for an attractive environment for cycling.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.1 The site is located around 250m from Altrincham public transport interchange on Stamford New Road (A538). These stops provide frequent services to a wide range of destinations including, Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Wythenshaw, Stockport, Warrington and Knutsford.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.2 The interchange also includes connectivity to the Metrolink network and rail connections with direct rail services to Manchester Piccadilly station and Chester.

Text: 3.3 Public Transport 3.3.3 It is feasible for staff and visitors to the site to travel on foot, on a bike. The site is also considered to be well placed in terms of public transport connectivity.

Text: 4 Measures 4 Measures

Text: 4 Measures 4.1 Introduction

Text: 4 Measures Implementation of the TP will require the following commitments, as a starting point:

Text: 4 Measures • appoint a Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC);

Text: 4 Measures • undertake travel surveys; and

Text: 4 Measures implement suitable measures.

Text: 4 Measures 4.2 Travel Plan Coordinators

Text: 4 Measures 4.2.1

Text: 4 Measures It is envisaged that a single TPC would be appointed to coordinate the implementation of the Travel Plan across for all users of the site. The TPC will act as a liaison point for any issues relating to the TP and will be responsible for developing the final TPs, which will be brought into action within 3 months of the first staff surveys.

Text: 4 Measures In terms of the roles and responsibilities, the TPC will be expected to:

Text: 4 Measures • administer/manage the TP and implement the plans with TC;

Text: 4 Measures • ensure travel awareness amongst staff;

Text: 4 Measures coordinate the travel surveys; and

Text: 4 Measures • promote and encourage the use of travel modes other than the car and car-sharing, where appropriate; and

Text: 4 Measures • ensure that all staff are made aware of the existence of the TP and its aims.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3 Travel Surveys

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.1 The first step to developing the operational TP is to establish how the patients make journeys to and from the site.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.2 A travel survey for staff based at the development will be conducted initially and then every two years thereafter as part of the monitoring and review process. The surveys will be performed in order to ascertain existing ‘baseline’ travel from which to measure changes in travel as a result of the TP.

Text: 4 Measures 4.3.3 The travel survey will be used to show how people travel to the site, what potential there is for change (for example, the numbers of people who would like to walk, cycle or use public transport, but are unable to do so), what are the most significant deterrents to using sustainable transport and what would encourage people to reduce car use. The following information can be obtained:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • how site users usually travel to and from the site;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • where site users are generally travelling to/from;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • if any places within the site are considered to be dangerous for walking or cycling, and why;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • how users of the site would like to travel if they had the choice and;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • whether they own a bicycle or have a travel pass for public transport.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.3.4 The full TP will be submitted to the LPA and LHA within 3 months of the first surveys.

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.4 Potential Measures

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk 4.4.1 The results of the travel surveys would be used to identify measures that would be effective in encouraging sustainable travel. The following is a list of measures that may be suitable for the proposed development:

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • agreeing to set up a ‘Cycle to work’ scheme whereby the costs of buying a bike is paid for through instalments and taken from employee salaries before taxation;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk issuing of personal safety alarms to staff;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • provision of lockers for people wishing to walk, run or cycle;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk • a guaranteed taxi home for people working late who may have walked or cycled to the site;

Text: www.eggtransport.co.uk funding of passes for public transport.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1 Introduction

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1.1 The monitoring and review programme will be designed to generate information which will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the TPs, revise measures and refine the plan over a 5- year period.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.1.2 On completion of the first travel survey, it will be appropriate to set targets which seek to achieve an increased proportion of residents travelling by sustainable forms of transport.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2 Monitoring

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2.1 Monitoring would include items such as:

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring • establishing travel habits / modal split; and

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring • general feedback from staff, including identifying any barriers to using sustainable travel modes.

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring 5.2.2

Text: 5 Travel Plan Monitoring Information gathered as part of the continuous monitoring process would be made available to TC. Through this medium, future strategies for further TP objectives can be considered in partnership between the occupiers of the site and TC.
