Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON Barnes Wlaker have collaborated with Jonathan Riddle Architects to prepare the Landscape Design.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The garden setting has remained unchanged for many years and has been waiting for a makeover to support the appearance and functioning of the house.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The landscape design will rationalise the spaces around the house and create a greatly enhanced setting for the refurbished property.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The Rhododendrons have extended massively towards the south and the property and cover almost half the front garden. These will be coppiced back to rationalised stumps to allow for a new cycle of growth. The new loose gravel drive will provide generous parking for 2-3 cars and leave an open view towards the front courtyard. One of the two original gate piers still exists with the top of the second lying on the ground. The second pier will be rebuilt across the double opening to better bookend the shared drive approach, rows of setts will link these two features.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON This set piece space addresses the front door and serves as a transition between front and rear gardens. Presently this space is compromised by the blank rendered wall of the neighbouring property and the unnecessarily low ground levels. The levels in the area dip down to then rise again towards the rear patio. The proposal is to raise levels so that only 2 steps are needed into the house.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON A metal trellis will provide a high-level frame for climbing roses with a lower section providing security and an enclosure for the family pet dog. The small pair of gates will act as a welcoming feature into the private courtyard.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The arrival courtyard leads out to the private rear garden areas via a mainly solid timber gate, storage areas for bins, bikes and general paraphernalia will be created behind a brick wall structure. This simple structure will appear as a garden wall from the front and neighbouring property. A section enclosed by doors will provide secure storage where as an open section will offer a neat place for bins and logs and have a depth of view from the utility window. The terrace will be surfaced in natural stone paving leading onto a simple grass bank. Beyond this area the garden will remain unchanged.

Text: LANDSCAPE DESIGN THE OLD VICARAGE, PARK ROAD, BOWDON The new garden setting will compliment the house and its proposed extensions and make a positive contribution to the area.
