Text: Installation advice & safety For full installation details, please see the relevant install guide on our website.

Text: Installation advice & safety ● Certiﬁed Pod Point installations include RCD protection ﬁtted at source, providing full guaranteed protection for the entire installation.

Text: Installation advice & safety Pod Point can provide a full turn-key service for the installation and commissioning of the chargepoint.

Text: Installation advice & safety The Solo 3 is designed for internal or external ﬁtment.

Text: Installation advice & safety An Energy Clamp option is available for single-phase units that protects the site’s main fuse from overcurrents that may result from the additional supply load when charging an EV.

Text: Installation advice & safety ●

Text: Installation advice & safety ● Our integrated 6mA DC Leakage protection is fully compliant with BS 7671:2018. This can be used safely in conjunction with a double or four pole Type A RCD/RCBO instead of requiring a more costly Type B RCD.

Text: Installation advice & safety ● The Solo 3 (Commercial) employ dual redundant safety power contacts, genuine Mennekes sockets with a safety locking feature and overcurrent protection for the user’s connected charging cable.

Text: Beneﬁts Beneﬁts

Text: Beneﬁts The Solo 3 (Commercial) is compatible with PAYG (pay as you go) software functionality via the Pod Point App and are individually identiﬁable with two 4 letter names (XXXX-XXXX) The Pod Point App provides usage data for both home and commercial points.

Text: Beneﬁts The Solo 3 (Commercial) can be used with Pod Point’s Array Charging load management system, allowing more charging points than the supply would normally allow. Please refer to the array datasheet on our technical documents webpage for more information.

Text: Beneﬁts UK and European based manufacturing facilities are used for production and in-house customer support teams are locally based, providing best in class support for its users.

Text: After sales service After sales service

Text: After sales service ● We will not undertake any repairs for any out-of-warranty failures without ﬁrst receiving acceptance of our quotation for related costs. Refer to the Solo Charger - Commercial installation guide for further details of supply requirements. Our Support team can be contacted by email aftersalessupport@pod-point.com.

Text: Smart Charging Smart Charging

Text: Smart Charging ● Our hardware is designed to operate in coordination with grid demands. In periods of peak local, regional or national demand, charging may be interrupted or rate-limited for brief periods to facilitate grid management. Pod Point will manage these limits to mitigate any signiﬁcant effects on vehicle charging overall.

Text: Limitations of use Limitations of use

Text: Limitations of use ● Pod Point do not authorise the use of charging cable adaptors and “smart” cables due to their impact on safety.* Our chargers must only be used with European certiﬁed vehicles and cables (damaged or non-approved cables should not be used with any EVSE or vehicles).

Text: Limitations of use *BS EN61851-1 forbids the use of in cable adaptors and cables that change the operational state of the EVSE (smart cables).

Text: Warranty and support Warranty and support

Text: Warranty and support To maintain our warranty, the installation shall be in accordance with Pod Point’s guidance, comply with relevant legislation and be installed by a certiﬁed electrician.

Text: Warranty and support Any hardware failure should be promptly reported to us, ideally by visit our contact-us page You must quote the serial number and location of the product with a brief description of the failure.

Text: Warranty and support Our Support team will then investigate and attempt to remotely resolve the issue. They may ask you to provide additional information to assist in this.

Text: Warranty and support If the issue cannot be resolved remotely, and the product is within warranty, we will arrange for one of our team to visit. If the issue is a result of any shortcoming in design or manufacture it will be made good free of charge or, at our option, exchanged for a replacement product. If we attend the site and the fault is not a result of a design or manufacture issue of our product, we will make reasonable attempts to diagnose the issue and propose a resolution which may have an associated fee. A call out fee will be applicable where our product is not at fault.

Text: Limitation of liability Limitation of liability

Text: Limitation of liability In no event will we accept any liability for any loss, costs or damages consequential of the use and/or misuse of our hardware products, except and only to the extent that this is caused by our negligence.
