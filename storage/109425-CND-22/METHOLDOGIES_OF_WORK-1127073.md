Text: Takedown 1. Photograph gable end prior to commencement of takedown, mark

Text: Takedown up special bricks, cills etc to ensure they are rebuilt as per original.

Text: Takedown 2. Starting from the top down, remove brick on edge copings by breaking bed & perpend joints

Text: Takedown by use of both hand & mechanical tools and remove bricks one by one. Repeat same process for the brickwork to the gable end.

Text: Takedown 3. At all stages care is to be taken to minimise any damage caused to the brickwork.

Text: Takedown 4. Bricks are to be stacked behind workers and transferred to the loading bay.

Text: Takedown 5. Bricks will be assessed at this stage and any defective bricks will be put on one pallet for disposal off site and suitable sound bricks will be cleaned off and stacked on another pallet, repeating process until completed.

Text: Takedown 6. Cleaning off will be carried out by use of hand tools to remove any existing mortar. Stubborn

Text: Takedown areas may require spinning off to minimise any damage to the arrises of the bricks.

Text: Takedown 7. Special bricks around windows, kneelers, voussoirs, and key stones are to be numbered up

Text: Takedown and palletised separately.

Text: Takedown 8. Once the bricks are stacked at the point of use, they should be protected from the elements

Text: Takedown whilst bricklaying is not in progress.

Text: Takedown 9. Once section has been removed, clean area and remove any remaining debris.

Text: Rebuild Rebuild

Text: Rebuild 10. Take from storage area reusable bricks and newly supplied reclaimed bricks where possible

Text: Rebuild ensure bricks are well blended to avoid colour banding or patches within the finished brickwork.

Text: Rebuild 11. Rebuild wall in same bond as original (photos taken before hand) Bricks should be laid on a full bed of mortar, perpends should be fully filled. Partially filled cross joints are the most significant factor in increasing the brickworks vulnerability to rain penetration so full spread of mortar to brick will be applied and enforced by supervisor.

Text: Rebuild 12. Compress mortar well into joints using pointing tools/irons that fit into the joints, so they

Text: Rebuild are fully filled.

Text: Rebuild 13. Ensure that no mortar encroaches/smears upon the face of the brickwork. Finish joints neatly as specified when the mortar is setting, but before it is fully set. Stipple the surface with a stiff bristle brush (tapping is preferable to dragging). This will expose the aggregate for appearance and better weathering. Differences in timing and techniques may give rise to inconsistencies in the visual appearance and performance. The optimal timing of finishing the joints will depend on the brick type, mortar mix and the weather. Correct timing will become apparent to an experienced and practised bricklayer following construction of the initial courses.

Text: Rebuild 15. During breaks in construction, particular care should be taken to keep bricks and brickwork in progress covered with waterproof sheeting, to ensure that materials and brickwork are adequately protected from inclement weather.

Text: Rebuild 16. Bricklaying should normally cease when the temperature is 3° Celsius and falling and not begin again until the temperature reaches 3° Celsius and rising. If overnight frost is likely to occur before the mortar within newly constructed brickwork has fully set, it should be protected with an insulating layer of hessian or frost blankets underneath the polythene. This would normally give some protection to the mortar joints from the actions of overnight frost.

Text: Replacement Bricks Replacement Bricks

Text: Replacement Bricks 1. Bricks are to be sourced from local reclamation yard and are to be approved. They will be

Text: Replacement Bricks used only if they are free from fungus, have no deep or extensive cracks, or damaged corners or arrises, and are free from old mortar. Sample to be provided prior to commencement of works.

Text: Restoration Bricks / Cills ThermaTech superheated water cleaning equipment. Conceived for the requirements of building conservation, restoration and refurbishment, this system is highly effective for removing soot, grease, oil, and organic matter from a wide range of substrates.

Text: Restoration Bricks / Cills The ThermaTech system produces superheated water, a liquid spray at 150°C. This temperature is capable of melting and removing many paints, surface treatments, chewing gum, wax and bitumen.

Text: Restoration Bricks / Cills ThermaTech reduces reliance on chemicals and boosts the performance of milder agents. It also uses less water than conventional hot and cold-water pressure washers. In this way it yields positive results for COSHH and REACH in safety and environmental risk assessment.
