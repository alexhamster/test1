Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION This method statement has been compiled by Mount Acre Homes on the instruction of Quinta Group Ltd to set out the proposed methodology for the demolition and reconstruction of the former St. Johns Medical Centre, St. Johns Road, Altrincham.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION The purpose of the proposed methodology is to protect the structural and historic qualities of the retained buildings and in the interests of visual amenity - having regard to Policy L7 of the Trafford Core Strategy and the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION Mount Acre Homes have produced this method statement with reference to good practice and project experience of restoration of historic buildings. The document also refers to the Significance Appraisal and heritage impact assessment undertaken by Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION The former medical centre is a two storey building, built with a combination of facing materials including brick, decorative timber and stone. The external structure is set under a king-pin-joist supported, slate roof. The building was formerly a school before being used as a medical centre and due to its external appearance is considered to contribute to the character of the Conservation Area. Nevertheless, the transformation of the interior means that the former school retains no internal architectural interest. The Heritage significance appraisal concludes the building is a ‘non-designated heritage asset’.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION It is proposed to carefully demolish the rear half of the building (illustrated below) during which roof slates, king pin joists and building stone will be salvaged. It is proposed to incorporate these salvaged materials into the new build component of the scheme, in accordance with approved architectural plans.

Text: SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION prior to commencement of demolition works a Level 2 Historic Building Survey will be carried out in accordance with the requirements of ‘Understanding Historic Buildings: A Guide to Good Recording Practise’. The survey report will be submitted to the Local Planning Authority.

Text: SECTION 2 - DEMOLITION SECTION 2 - DEMOLITION

Text: SECTION 2 - DEMOLITION The Contract Administrator will submit a Section 80 Notice of Intended Demolition to the Local Authority prior to the Works commencing. The Contractor will establish a site compound within the existing temporary car park for welfare and material storage. The compound is enclosed via secured fencing. The demolition works will be undertaken in three phases as follows:

Text: Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal

Text: Phase 1 – Asbestos Removal The building owner commissioned an Asbestos Refurbishment and Demolition Survey by a UKAS accredited Surveyor. All asbestos containing materials have been removed from the entire premises by a licenced contractor in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, HSE Guidance Notes and good practice. These materials were removed from site to a licensed waste facility for processing.

Text: Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out

Text: Phase 2 – Internal Strip Out Internal fixtures and fittings have been stripped from the premises along with internal walls and floors. Waste material was disposed off-site to a licenced waste facility.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Phase 3 – Demolition of Building

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Demolition of building areas, illustrated in planning application approved by Local Authority. Screened access scaffolding will be erected and later dismantled to allow for the separation of the roofs and external walls from the original and adjacent structures. The separation will be by hand via operatives on the scaffolding. The original slate roofs will be stripped by hand with any slates suitable for re-use lowered to ground level and stacked on pallets within the site compound for re-use. The rainwater goods are on the whole not suitable for re-use and will be removed and disposed of.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building The timber roof structure (king pin joists) appear to be in good condition, however the extent of their structural integrity, overall condition, and pitch compatibility for the new roof, cannot be determined due to internal access restrictions. The decorative king pin joists will be

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Planning Reference no: 101163/FUL/20

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building carefully removed, restored if necessary, then safely warehoused on site in preparation for future use.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building Demolition of the superstructure will commence from the rear of the building taking down any remaining internal and external walls. The walls will be taken down by hand from the scaffolding with stones cleaned and stacked on pallets for re-use. The ground floors and foundations will be grubbed up by mechanical means and removed from site. Dust suppression will be used as necessary.

Text: Phase 3 – Demolition of Building We anticipate from site inspection that some of the original masonry will not be suitable for re-use due to its condition. Where materials cannot be re-used, they will be carefully recorded for reference during the re-construction.

Text: SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS

Text: SECTION 3 – RECONSTRUCTION WORKS It is proposed to re-construct part of the roof and rear external facade of the former medical centre using the salvaged materials from the demolition works. Consented architectural plans will be used as the basis for re-reconstruction. Where salvaged material from the original buildings is not available, or its condition is not suitable for re-use, materials will be imported and incorporated on a like for like basis with samples to be agreed with the Planning Officer. New external doors and windows will be installed to the existing openings in accordance with the requirements of the Local Planning Authority. Any materials not re-used during the re- construction works will be recorded and disposed off-site to a licenced waste facility.
