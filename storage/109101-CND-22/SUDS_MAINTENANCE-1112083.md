Text: General Requirements General Requirements

Text: General Requirements Collection of all litter and debris from communal areas is to be undertaken on a monthly basis by the management company. Home owners should be made aware of the permeable road build ups and should avoid the use of chemical weed killers and de-icing agents where possible.

Text: Financial Management Financial Management

Text: Financial Management It is proposed that all SuDS facilities will be managed and maintained in perpetuity by a the homeowner. The homeowner will be responsible for the management and maintenance of all drainage systems within their site boundary in accordance with this document. The homeowner should ensure regular maintenance of the Klargester Bio-disc is undertaken as per the specialist maintenance plans, and should be undertaken by a competent person.

Text: Modular Cellular Storage Modular Cellular Storage

Text: Modular Cellular Storage These comprise of geo-cellular (hollow box) systems wrapped in an impermeable geo-textile. The units have a high void ratio (often 95%) to provide storm-water storage underground. Water from the building roof and associated hardstanding areas (including pavements, driveways and roads) is routed to a series of these cellular storage tanks. The storage tank location and arrangements can be found on Bell Munro Consulting Drawing number J7647/EX01. The maintenance of the modular cellular storage is to be undertaken by the home owner or their appointed management company. The operation and maintenance requirements are given in the table below;

Text: Vortex Flow Controls Vortex Flow Controls

Text: Vortex Flow Controls These are proprietary systems which are custom made to control the discharge off site to greenfield or brownfield levels. Some of the proposed flow controls may be prone to blocking and should be monitored closely. The maintenance of the flow control is to be undertaken by the home owner or their appointed management company. The operation and maintenance requirements are given in the table below;

Text: Inlet Structures and Inspection Chambers Inlet structures such as rain water down pipes, road gullies and channel drawings. They should be free from obstruction at all times to allow free flow through SuDS. Inspection chambers and rodding eyes are used on bends or where pipes come together. They allow access and cleaning to the system if necessary.

Text: Design Life Design Life

Text: Design Life The design life of the development is likely to exceed the design life of each of the SUDs components listed above. During the routine inspections of any drainage components, it may become apparent that they have reached the end of their functional lifetime. In the interest of sustainability repairs should be the first-choice solution where possible. If this is not the case then it may be necessary for the property owners (if on their property) or the management company to undertake complete replacement of the component in question.

Text: Emergency Plan Key indicators to prevent flooding;

Text: Emergency Plan 1. Manholes over flowing

Text: Emergency Plan WRYeENP

Text: Emergency Plan 2. Vent pipe overflowing

Text: Emergency Plan 3. Gullies overflowing or water taking a long time to disperse

Text: Emergency Plan 4. Aco channels overflowing or water taking a long time to disperse

Text: Emergency Plan 5. Any other unusual visual items not normally seen such as waterlogged ground

Text: Emergency Plan In the event of the above occurring, action is required to be undertaken as outlined below;

Text: Emergency Plan 1. Check for obvious blockages in area where flooding is occurring (blocked gully’s / drains / flow control units etc).

Text: Emergency Plan 2. If there is nothing obvious as to why there is a blockage, call the statutory wastewater provider – United Utilities to make them aware and report the problem on 0345 672 3723

Text: Emergency Plan 3. Call a suitable drain inspection company such as ‘Lanes for Drains’ to survey and possibly jet any blockages. Local depot contact number – 0161 788 2222 and inform them of the problems.

Text: Emergency Plan Ensure that in the event of the above, the operation, maintenance and emergency plans as well as the drainage drawings for the development are available to the contractors.

Text: Spillage – Emergency action Spillage – Emergency action

Text: Spillage – Emergency action Most spillages on a development are of compounds that do not pose a serious risk to the environment if they enter the drainage system in a slow and controlled manner with available time for natural breakdown. Therefore, small spillages of oil, milk or other known organic substances should be remove where possible using soak mats as recommended by the Environment Agency, with residual spillage allowed to bioremediate in the drainage system.

Text: Spillage – Emergency action In the event of a serious spillage, either by volume of unknow or toxic compounds, then isolate the spillage with soil, turf or fabric and block outlet pipes from chambers downstream of the spillage with a bung.
