Text: SUMMARY SUMMARY

Text: SUMMARY At 2 Groby Place in Altrincham planning permission is being sought to extend the house.

Text: SUMMARY As this could impact on features typically used by bats as roosting places, a diurnal inspection was undertaken on 22nd July 2022 to assess the building for signs of bat occupation.

Text: SUMMARY All the external and internal structures, especially those associated with the roof and walls of the building were examined.

Text: SUMMARY No signs of bat activity or occupation were found, and the suitability for roosting pipistrelles Pipistrellus sp or other bat species was considered negligible, as there were no suitable crevices or gaps.

Text: SUMMARY At the time of the survey, 2 Groby Place was not identified as a bat roost or hibernation site, and as such no further surveys or mitigation measures are required.

Text: SUMMARY *

Text: SUMMARY No bird nests were found either in or on 2 Groby Place.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION In mid-July 2022, Indigo Surveys was instructed to undertake a bat survey of 2 Groby Place Altrincham. On 22nd July 2022, a visit was made to the property to carry out a diurnal inspection of the building to check for signs of bat occupation.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The result of the survey is contained in this report.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION In England, Scotland and Wales, all bat species are fully protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) (as amended), through inclusion in Schedule 5. In England and Wales this Act has been amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW), which adds an extra offence, makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions, and increases penalties.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION All bats are also included in Schedule 2 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 1994, (or Northern Ireland 1995) (the Habitats Regulations), which defines ‘European protected species of animals’.

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The above legislation can be summarised thus (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004):

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION Intentionally or deliberately kill, injure or capture (or take) bats

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION oooooo

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Deliberately disturb bats (whether in a roost or not)

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Recklessly disturb roosting bats or obstruct access to their roosts

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Damage or destroy roosts

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Possess or transport a bat or any part of a part of a bat, unless acquired legally

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION ❑ Sell (or offer for sale) or exchange bats, or parts of bats

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION The word ‘roost’ is not used in the legislation but is used here for simplicity. The actual wording is ‘any structure or place which any wild animal…uses for shelter or protection’ (WCA), or ‘breeding site or resting place’ (Habitats Regulations).

Text: 1. INTRODUCTION As bats generally have both a winter and a summer roost, the legislation is clear that all roosts are protected whether bats are in residence at the time or not.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY 2. METHODOLOGY

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY To fully assess bat occupation of a particular site, the Bat Conservation Trust (2016) recommends that information gathered from a desk study of known bat records, and a daytime site walkover, is used to inform the type and extent of future bat survey work, potentially including nocturnal surveys.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY The diurnal walkover provides an opportunity to check for signs of occupancy, such as droppings, scratch marks, feeding remains, carcasses, or even animals in residence, whilst nocturnal surveys (if required) allow numbers and species of bats to be confirmed. The latter are also used to determine the presence or absence of bats, where signs of bat activity are indeterminate or absent, but suitability of roosting considered to be medium to high.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Roosting places vary depending on the species. Pipistrelles usually inhabit narrow cracks or cavities around the outside of buildings, but they will roost in similar niches inside larger barns. Typical sites include soffit spaces, gaps behind fascia boards and end rafters, crevices around the ends of projecting purlins, under warped or lifted roof and ridge tiles, or in gaps in stone and brickwork where mortar has dropped out.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Larger species such as Brown Long-eared Bats Plecotus auritus, Myotis bats (Natterer’s Myotis nattereri and Whiskered/Brandt’s M. mystacinus/M. brandtii), and Lesser Horseshoe Bats Rhinolophus hipposideros, like to roost in the roof voids of buildings, and can often be found hanging singly or in small groups from ridge boards or roof timbers, especially where they butt up against gable walls or chimney breasts. They especially favour older structures with timber frames. Here they squeeze into tight crevices making them difficult to observe.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Diurnal walkovers can be carried out at any time of the year, but nocturnal surveys should only be undertaken when bats are out of hibernation and in their summer roosts. The recommended period is from May to September inclusive, with May to August optimum and September sub- optimum. The season can be extended into October, although particularly cold weather will render this inadvisable. Indeed, the air temperature at the start of each survey must be at least 10°C or above.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Nocturnal Surveys will be a minimum of two weeks apart, and the number of surveys is dependent on the evidence found or the suitability of the site to bats.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Where bats are found, or there is evidence of bat occupation or activity, i.e., that bat use is confirmed, the number and timing of surveys will be decided by the ecologist and will be appropriate for the type of roost. In general, at least two nocturnal surveys will be carried out, both of which can be emergence surveys, or one emergence and one dawn re-entry.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Michelle Mulholland | CLIENT 2 Groby Place Altrincham WA14 4AL| SITE 220962 / E1| REF 25th August 2022 | DATE

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY Where there is no evidence of bat presence, and no suitability for roosting, no nocturnal surveys will be needed.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For a site with no evidence but low suitability, just one nocturnal emergence survey is required, this to be in the optimum period.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For medium suitability a minimum of two visits are needed, of which one must be in the optimum period, and one must be a dawn re-entry survey. With high suitability, three visits will be necessary, of which two must be in the optimum period. At least one of these must be a dawn re-entry survey, with the third visit either an emergence or a dawn re-entry.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY For sites < 5 ha in size, and/or regularly shaped structures, at least two surveyors must be present, with more surveyors at larger sites and more complex buildings, e.g., those with multiple elevations and/or roof structures.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY On 22nd July a thorough inspection of 2 Gorby Place was made by Neil Musgrave (Natural England bat licence No. 2020-44602-CLS-CLS), including the exterior and interior walls, roof coverings, roof void, eaves, gables, window casements and door frames.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY 8x42 binoculars and a Fenix TK75 torches were used for the inaccessible/unreachable areas. On this occasion an endoscope was not used, as there were no crevices and cavities that could not be inspected with a torch or by use of binoculars from a ladder.

Text: 2. METHODOLOGY The result of the survey is detailed in Section 3.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Bats tend to be seasonal visitors to properties and are not usually in occupation all year round. The females normally form maternity colonies during May or June and then leave for adjacent trees and/or woodland during July or August once the young bats are able to fly and become independent. Here they will spend the winter months in hibernation before returning to the house or barn the following spring.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Male bats generally live alone and have a number of favoured roosts. During the summer they visit each of these for a few days at a time, before moving to their chosen hibernation site in mid- late October. Different species have different habits, but this seasonal movement is common to all.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Bats choose their roosts carefully. During the summer they look for sites which are warmed by the sun, and as a result are most often found on the south and western side of buildings.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Pipistrelles, our smallest and commonest bats, prefer to roost in very confined spaces around the outside of buildings, typical places being behind hanging tiles, weather boarding, soffit, barge and eave boarding, between roof felt and roof tiles or in cavity walls.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As such they can be difficult to find, so the suitability for roosting was also assessed. This was considered negligible, as there were no suitable external crevices or cavities.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Another bat frequently encountered in buildings is the Brown Long-eared Bat. This is also a common species, but unlike pipistrelles, they prefer the dry, warm space of the loft or roof void, and can often be found hanging from roof timbers, especially rafters and the ridge board next to chimney breasts.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS No signs of Brown Long-eared Bat activity were found, nor evidence of other bat species which are commonly found inside buildings.

Text: 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS At the time of the survey, 2 Groby Place was not identified as a bat roost, and as such no further surveys or mitigation measures are required.
