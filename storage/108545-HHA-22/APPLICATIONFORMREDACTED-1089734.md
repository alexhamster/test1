Text: Pre-application Advice Details of the pre-application advice received

Text: Pre-application Advice Planning Portal Reference: PP-11371075

Text: Pre-application Advice Good speaking with you earlier. As requested I have summarised below the principles agreed in the meeting:

Text: Pre-application Advice Side /rear extension

Text: Pre-application Advice Revise roof design to a pitch, (which retains the existing first floor dressing room window on the original side elevation). Some conservation style rooflights within the roof agreed subject to design.

Text: Pre-application Advice To the rear of the side extension, rearranging internal layout to allow windows on the rear elevation.

Text: Pre-application Advice Single storey rear extension on the inside of the existing outrigger

Text: Pre-application Advice Roof design to be amended. Pitched with potential alterations to existing first floor bathroom window, in the side of the existing outrigger.

Text: Pre-application Advice First floor rear extension

Text: Pre-application Advice The first floor element seems to unbalance rear elevation and roof design is difficult. Ideally we would request the first floor extension is removed if possible. Would be happy to discuss alternative roof design if anything comes to mind.

Text: Pre-application Advice Materials

Text: Pre-application Advice Most proposed so far are acceptable (subject to details being agreed) i.e.:

Text: Pre-application Advice · Cheshire brick (brick window headers to match existing also)

Text: Pre-application Advice · Slate roof tiles

Text: Pre-application Advice · Painted timber window and door frames – flush casement with mullion bars to match existing.

Text: Pre-application Advice Aluminium RWG required (colour black) though, rather than UPVC.
