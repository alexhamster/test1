Text: 1 INTRODUCTION Wardell Armstrong LLP (WA) has been commissioned by PBS Group to prepare a scheme of air quality mitigation sufficient to discharge pre-commencement planning condition 21 of Trafford Council’s (TC) decision notice for the consented development situated at 46 — 50 Railway Street, Altrincham. Condition 21 of the decision notice is written as follows:

Text: 1 INTRODUCTION “Prior to works commencing on site, a report/scheme detailing steps to minimise exposure to air pollution shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme is to be completed prior to occupation of the development and shall be permanently maintained thereafter”.

Text: 1 INTRODUCTION REASON: In the interests of amenity of the future occupiers of the apartments hereby approved, having regard to Trafford Core Strategy Policies: L5.13 and L7.3 and advice within the NPPF. The condition requires the submission of information prior to the commencement of development because the approved details will need to be incorporated into the development at design stage.

Text: 1 INTRODUCTION The scheme of air quality mitigation detailed within this statement has been prepared in accordance with consultation undertaken with TC’s Pollution and Housing Team.

Text: 2 CONSULTATION 2 CONSULTATION

Text: 2 CONSULTATION 2.1 Consultation was undertaken with Ms Nasreen Ali, Environmental Health Officer for TC, by telephone and email communication on 20" to 22"? November 2019. A summary of the consultation is provided below.

Text: 2 CONSULTATION Details regarding the consented residential-led development were discussed, including the location of the development within Altrincham and its proximity to the A538 and the Greater Manchester Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). It was confirmed by WA that all residential dwellings, within the four blocks that comprise the development (i.e. Blocks A — D), will be serviced by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) units. The MVHR units will provide whole house continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery to achieve the ventilation rates required by Approved Document F of the building regulations.

Text: 2 CONSULTATION 2.2

Text: 2 CONSULTATION It was proposed by WA that the MVHR units servicing the residential floor within Block C, the closest block to the A538 and the Greater Manchester AQMA, would be adapted to include an air pollution filter (capable of filtering NOz, PMio and PMa:s). The filter would be maintained throughout the life of the development. It was discussed that this form of mitigation is, in principle, appropriate for the residential use of Block C. However, Ms Ali raised the requirement to consider the necessity of air pollution filtration throughout the other development blocks (i.e. A, B and D).

Text: 2 CONSULTATION 2.4

Text: 2 CONSULTATION Given the lack of onsite air quality information currently available for the development site, a potential mitigation option was discussed. Specifically, the discussed strategy would comprise installation of air pollution filters to all of the MHVR units servicing the residential dwellings across the entirety of the development site in the first instance. Subsequently, onsite assessment works would be undertaken to establish where the filters should be maintained, throughout the life of the development, and where they can be removed. Ms Ali provided an agreement to the proposed approach.

Text: 3 MITIGATION SCHEME 3.1 The residential dwellings, within the four blocks that comprise the development (i.e. Blocks A — D), will be serviced by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) units. The MVHR units will provide whole house continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery to achieve the ventilation rates required by Approved Document F of the building regulations.

Text: 3 MITIGATION SCHEME 3.2 All of the MVHR units will be adapted to include a Nuaire carbon filter (capable of filtering NOz, PMio and PM2:s) prior to any occupation of the residential dwellings (details regarding the relevant Nuaire carbon filter product range can be viewed here: https://www.nuaire.co.uk/residential/iaq-carbon-filter). All of the carbon filters should be maintained throughout the life of the development, to ensure that the filters are continuously operating in accordance with manufacturers specifications, or until evidence has been provided, and agreed with TC, that one or more of the MVHR carbon filters can be removed.

Text: 3 MITIGATION SCHEME 33 Evidence to support the removal of an MVHR carbon filter will need to be based on onsite air quality assessment works. The scope and methodology for any onsite air quality assessment works will need to be discussed and agreed with TC, prior to the works being undertaken. At this stage, it is considered that onsite air quality monitoring, comprising NO2 diffusion tube monitoring for a minimum period of three months, possibly supplemented with detailed air quality modelling would be a suitable scope of works for the assessment of onsite air quality.

Text: 3 MITIGATION SCHEME It is considered that the above approach is suitable for discharge of planning condition 21 of TC’s decision notice for the consented development situated at 46 — 50 Railway Street, Altrincham.
