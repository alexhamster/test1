Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION This assessment has been carried out in order to determine the impact of proposed alteration and reconstruction works on a Non-Designated Heritage Asset which is situated within a Conservation Area. The appraisal is concerned with the process of conserving the special architectural and historic interest of the building and preserving or enhancing the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.2

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION This appraisal has been conducted in accordance with the general guidelines set out in British Standard 7913:2013 ‘Guide to the Conservation of Historic Buildings’ and in particular responds to policies outlined in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF). In respect of information requirements, paragraph 189 sets out that:

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.”

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION 2.1

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION 46-50 Railway Street (the building) is a historic mid C19th Hotel originally known as The Downs Hotel, and former Public House which is situated at National Grid Reference SJ 76670 87609 and lies to the north of the junction of The Downs, Ashley Road, Lloyd Street and Railway Street.

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION 2.2

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION The building is situated within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area of Altrincham and is adjacent and close to the border with The Downs Conservation Area.

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION 2.3

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION The building is identified within Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal as a ‘key contributor’ to the historic character and appearance of the area and is therefore defined as a non-designated heritage asset.

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION 2.4

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION Non-designated heritage assets are defined by Historic England as ‘buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified by plan-making bodies as having a degree of heritage significance meriting consideration in planning decisions but which do not meet the criteria for designated heritage assets’.

Text: LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION The building is also highlighted within the Conservation Area Appraisal as a local landmark.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT 3.1

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal describes the contribution made by the building as follows:

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT This building reflects a substantial number of other elements in the Conservation Area in age, style, materials and form. This 2 storey property with painted brickwork has a pitched roof cladded with blue slate. The windows on the ground floor are tall in shape and have stone sills and headers, the first floor windows are vertical sliding sash windows which are painted in white. The entrance of the building has a solid wooded panelled door that has two decorative corbels beside it. The building was formerly The Downs Hotel, later a public house. The building has an irregular form and a symmetrical composition. The building reflects the traditional former uses in the area. It illustrates the development of the settlement in which it stands.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The Conservation Area Appraisal reports the condition of the building as ‘fair’.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT 3.3

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The summary of Conservation Area’s special interest as set out within the appraisal and to which the building contributes is as follows:

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The focus of the Conservation Area is along the gentle curve of Railway Street and Stamford New Road leading to Altrincham Interchange. The predominate land use of the area tends to be commercial and retail on ground floors with offices, storage or some residential on upper floors.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The designation combines early 19th century development along Railway Street with a cohesive group of good quality late 19th and early 20th century buildings along Stamford New Road and adjoining streets, testifying to the prosperity and confidence of the town.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT Building elevations fronting the street display a variety of good quality architectural styles,

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT detailing and expression, particularly to upper floors, which contribute a high level of aesthetic

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT and historic value to the Conservation Area. There are a number of consistent design details

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT for example the use of splayed corners and plaques with names, initial and dates displayed.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT Generally buildings sited along Railway Street are 2 storeys in height and domestic in scale increasing to 3 storeys and a larger scale along Stamford New Road and some adjoining streets. Buildings tend to be traditional in form with pitched roofs, and front the street. In a number of cases the plot ratio is greater in depth than width, although there are some exceptions. The scale, massing and form of buildings results in a strong building line and sense of enclosure, this contributes to the visual interest and rhythm of the streetscene.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT There are a number of significant pedestrian routes, ginnels and open spaces which contribute to the finer grain and spatial interest of the Conservation Area. There are often good views from these routes to the plainer, often unaltered and functional historic rear elevations, outriggers and outbuildings which contribute positively to the integrity and evolution of the Conservation Area.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The consistent use of traditional building materials and local details repeated throughout the Conservation Area provides a sense of visual harmony. The majority of buildings are constructed from red brick laid in traditional bonds with pitched blue slate roofs and painted

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT 6

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT timber windows. There is variation in the tonal range of red brick and embellishment is usually picked out in terracotta, gauged brick or sandstone. There are smaller numbers of buildings constructed from sandstone or white brick.

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT •

Text: 3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT The area is defined by the railway, both historically and physically. Railway Street was renamed in 1849 with the advent of the railway. Stamford New Road was created after 1880 when Altrincham and Bowdon Station replaced the two earlier stations. The name declares the importance of the Earl of Stamford as a major landowner in the area. In the second half of 20th century Altrincham Station was developed to accommodate a significant transport interchange and in 2014 is undergoing major refurbishment.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.1

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES In assessing proposed changes to the building, an appraisal of the significance of the elements due to change has been carried out. This process relates to the assessment of a range of heritage values as outlined by Historic England; formerly English Heritage in the 2008 guidance document which have been revised for the 2017 draft document.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES These values are distilled under the following headings: Historic Interest (including Communal Interest), Archaeological Interest (formerly Evidential Value) and Architectural and Artistic Interest (formerly Aesthetic Value). The purpose of assessing these values is to enable an assessment of the site’s significance - whether physically manifest (e.g. architectural features) or in some other less tangible form (e.g. historical associations) - so as to enhance the objective appraisal of proposals for the change to the building.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES In essence this follows the approach generally advocated by Historic England, whereby necessary change in the historic environment is intelligently managed. A brief summary of the heritage values associated with the site, and more specifically those parts due to change under the proposals being considered, is given below, together with an indication on how these values contribute to the appraisal of significance

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES Historic Interest (Historic / Communal Value)

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.2.1 Historic England consider that historical interest “can illustrate the story of past events, people and aspects of life” (EH.2017.s28). This is generally regarded as either Illustrative whereby the building or element can be perceived to represent a period in history, Associative where a connection with an event or person can contribute to the historic significance of a site or Communal; where the it may invoke emotion or contribute to an individual’s or community’s sense of place or where a place can be a form of catalyst for memories associated with it or.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.2.2 The building is illustrative of a significant period in local history and is one of the many buildings which represents a period where the town was experiencing enormous growth and positive change.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.2.3 The building’s origin and historic purpose is associated with the railway and the extension to the Bowdon Terminus.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 7

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.2.4 The building is a noted local landmark and holds some communal value, perhaps more as part of a group than individually, but local residents will draw some pride and sense of place from historic buildings such as this.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES Figure 2. Historic image circa 1912. The Downs Hotel evident with polychromatic brickwork to the now demolished neighbouring building. Note the location of the cart entrance being on the other side to where it exists today.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.3 Archaeological Interest (Evidential Value)

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.3.1 Described by Historic England as “evidence of past human activity” (EH.2017.s38), archaeological interest is derived from one’s ability to interpret the history and historic evolution of an asset through visible and tangible features whether superficially evident or that could be revealed through investigation.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.3.2 The building retains little if anything of value internally and has been heavily modified so extensively that interpretation of historic room arrangement and plan form is not reasonably possible on any informed basis. The chimney stacks to the north side party walls remain whereas the one to the southern gable as evident in Figure 2 has been lost.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.3.3 Externally the building has received extensive modern intervention, broadly cosmetic with the significant features still evident. The remains of the neighbouring building which was lost some years ago appear to be non-original with the cart access having been relocated, this significantly devalues this section of the building.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.3.4 The introduction of the railway defined the development of the area thereafter and therefore, buildings which came about as a result of the railway remain as tangible evidence of this and the evolution of the character of the area during the middle to latter part of the C19th.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 8

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES Architectural and Artistic Interest (Aesthetic Value)

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.4.1 Architectural and Artistic Interest according to Historic England “derives from a contemporary appreciation of the asset’s aesthetics” (EH.2017.s42) and relates to sensory and intellectual stimulation and may be derived from detailed design produced by an architect or designer, or from direct creation by a craftsman or sculptor.

Text: 4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.4.2 Notwithstanding the modern changes, the building retains its architectural form and essentially its historic identity. The painted brick somewhat detaches it visually from its contemporaries but it still presents as a significant structure along the street-scene.

Text: 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE

Text: 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 5.1

Text: 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Having assessed the heritage values associated with the site, it is possible to take a more informed approach to the assessment of site significance. This is usually done by attributing levels of significance to the various aspects/parts of a building or site whereby, for example, more modern or unsympathetic additions to a historic building are deemed of less significance than, say, original features.

Text: 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 5.2 In attributing levels of significance to the asset as a whole or elements of the asset, levels of significance are graded as follows:

Text: EXCEPTIONAL EXCEPTIONAL

Text: EXCEPTIONAL This would correspond to an individual Grade I or II* Listed Building or an element which is intact, has a special interest, and makes an important contribution to the wider significance of the building.

Text: HIGH HIGH

Text: HIGH A designated heritage asset which has significance at national level, such as Grade II listed buildings or an element which is relatively intact, has a special interest and makes an important contribution to the wider significance of the building.

Text: MEDIUM MEDIUM

Text: MEDIUM A non-designated heritage asset such as a Locally Listed Building which is considered to be important at a local to regional level or an element which has been altered, has less special interest, and its contribution to the wider significance of the site is less important. May include less significant parts of statutorily Listed Buildings.

Text: MEDIUM Medium significance can be attributed to the building’s associative, illustrative and communal values. Its presence is a contributory reminder of the historic development of the town and is of some importance at local level.

Text: MEDIUM Medium significance can also be attributed to the architectural interest the building holds. Somewhat diluted by modern intervention and limited to the façade, its impact when viewed from within the public realm is of value.

Text: MEDIUM 9

Text: MEDIUM 5.3

Text: LOW LOW

Text: LOW A non-designated asset important at a local level such as a building which makes a positive contribution to a Conservation Area (key building) or an element which has been significantly altered, has a low level of integrity, the special interest has been lost and it makes little contribution to the wider significance of the site.

Text: NEUTRAL NEUTRAL

Text: NEUTRAL An element which is considered to be historically unimportant but does not have a harmful impact on a heritage asset. This may include insignificant interventions to designated and non- designated heritage assets and buildings that do not make a positive contribution to a Conservation Area.

Text: NEUTRAL Neutral significance can be attributed to the remaining structure behind the façade, with most elements of any limited heritage value lost to previous works.

Text: INTRUSIVE INTRUSIVE

Text: INTRUSIVE An element which is considered to be historically unimportant and has a harmful impact on a heritage asset.

Text: INTRUSIVE Intrusive elements are the low-quality changes to the building externally and primarily to the front. Previous alterations have been harmful to the architectural appearance of the building and consequently have also been causative of harm to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: INTRUSIVE On balance, the overall historic significance of the building in local context is considered to be LOW to MEDIUM and is limited to what remains of the original building which both serves as a reminder of its, and the local area’s history and contributes to the character of the Conservation Area.

Text: INTRUSIVE This can essentially be narrowed down to the frontage of the building and significant elements which can be viewed from the highway. The façade of the building maintains both its presence and its aesthetic contribution.

Text: INTRUSIVE 10

Text: INTRUSIVE 11

Text: 6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW 6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW

Text: 6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW 6.1

Text: 6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW The proposals comprise the retention of the existing façade including the roof and part of the gable end, the upward and outward extension of the existing archway, and the erection of a two-storey building comprising a ground floor mixed used commercial and business floorspace (Use Class E), with a single residential apartment (Use Class C3) above, together with associated works.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 7.1 To follow is a detailed critical analysis of the proposed changes. The purpose of this analysis is to manage the change using methodology as advocated by Historic England (2008) and is categorised as follows:

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Proposal: Brief description of the proposal together with an assessment to establish whether there is enough information to comprehensively understand the impact of the proposals on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposals to retain the façade of the building include works to remove the modern window awnings, renovate the sash windows at first floor level (or replace on a like-for-like basis if too damaged) and replace the modern PVC windows at ground floor level with painted hardwood windows. The drawings appear to propose a simpler and modern interpretation of the original window design. The chimney stacks, which are significant indicators of historic plan form as well as important features, are to be re-pointed with lime mortar.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposals include for raising the opening to what was considered to be the remaining structure and cart entrance to the neighbouring building. This is to allow emergency vehicles to pass through and access the new development to the rear.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Impact: Consideration of the effects of the proposal on authenticity and integrity of the heritage values attributed to the building or area.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposed changes to the façade of the building further reveal elements of heritage value which contribute to both its architectural interest and its appearance from within the public realm and are therefore welcomed. The removal of the PVC windows and replacement with painted hardwood units will reinstate historic consistency in terms of material use and quality.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Having been vacant for a period of time, the building appeared to have limited viability for proposals relating to its original and historic use, the proposals retain the presence of the building and ultimately preserve its illustrative, associative and communal values.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The Conservation Area Appraisal identifies views along Railway Street as being ‘Key Views’. Such views are considered important as an integral component in experiencing, enjoying and understanding

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 12

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT the historic character of an area. Historic England advocate an approach to assessing heritage within views which is essentially proportionate to the value of the assets within the views:

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT VIEW A. View from the junction at the end of The Downs looking north up Railway Street. The position of this view sits approximately on the boundary of The Downs Conservation Area and is also contributory to its historic character and appearance.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT VIEW B. View from the station end of Railway Streel looking south towards the road junction at The Downs. The Bank at 1-5 The Downs is very much the focal point of this view and is identified within the Conservation Area Appraisal as a local landmark.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 13

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The view up Railway Street in both directions is dominated by the large multi-storey developments to the east on the site of the original Bowdon Terminus, but this serves to enhance the importance of the line of historic buildings which run along the west side of the road, to the Conservation Area.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The building is prominent within these views, the painted brickwork at least draws the eye towards the side of the road with historic integrity and is arguably a reasonable counter-balance to the mass of the opposing modern development.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The retention of the façade of the building and its southern gable, together with the neighbouring low- level frontage and cart entrance, albeit non-original, is clearly important to preserving associative, illustrative and communal values and also the historic character of the area. The demolition and reconstruction work to the rear of the building will have no perceivable impact.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposed changes to the frontage of the building will bring about positive change, primarily to the aesthetics within the views, but also the authenticity and integrity of the quality of the buildings within the views.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Reversibility: Whilst the quality of the architecture and intended specification of materials is intended to last the test of time, this is not always a given. Should the proposal not perform as expected, consideration is given to the ease of reversibility so as not to prejudice alternative future solutions.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposed works to the rear of the building are entirely benign in terms of impact on historic significance and the contribution they make to the character and appearance of the Conservation, and therefore reversibility is not a material consideration.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The changes to the front of the building are wholly positive and while the proposals do represent a departure from the building’s original and historic use, flexibility appears to exist whereby the building could function as a Hotel and Public House without the requirement for significant alterations. In that regard, the proposals do not prejudice future alternative solutions.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Mitigation: Consideration of the necessity mitigate the impact of loss of any element of historic significance resulting from the proposals.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The demolition of the structure to the rear of the façade will of course result in the loss of a small amount of historic and original building fabric, although nothing of particular importance in terms of features or craftsmanship. The building holds no greater value than its contribution to the Conservation Area and the preservation of its presence and architectural integrity overwhelmingly mitigate against any perceived loss.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT Compensation: Consideration of any consequential conservation-based benefits resulting from the proposal.

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 14

Text: 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT The proposals clearly retain the most significant elements of the building which contribute to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, while preparing it for continued viable and sustainable use whereby it will not remain unoccupied and its future will be secured in the medium to long term.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.1

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 46 – 50 Railway Street, Altrincham is a historic hotel dating from the mid C19th. The building is neither statutorily nor locally listed but does lie within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area of Altrincham as designated and under the authority of Trafford Council.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.2

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The building has been identified within the local authority Conservation Area Appraisal as a ‘Positive Contributor’ to the historic character and appearance of the area and also a local landmark is therefore defined as a ‘Non-Designated Heritage Asset’. The building is also visible from within the neighbouring The Downs Conservation Area to which it also makes a positive contribution.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.3 The building has struggled since around 2004 to remain in use as a Public House/Bar and has been vacant for some time and as such, alternative uses have been considered.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.4

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The building has been substantially altered and extended in recent years resulting in the loss of its original and historic plan form.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.5

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The façade of the building has been significantly altered in recent years albeit mostly cosmetic but ultimately harmful.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.6

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The heritage assessment section of this document concludes that the building’s presence, identity and architectural interest are of most significance in terms of its contribution to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area. This primarily lies within what is visible from the main highways i.e. the façade and southern gable.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.7

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The proposals comprise reconstruction of the building, retaining its façade, carrying out enhancement works to the principal elevation and developing the site for commercial use at ground floor and residential use at first floor.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.8

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This document contends that the proposals result in no perceivable harm to the heritage values attributed to the building and the contribution it makes to the Conservation Area.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.9 This document also contends that the proposed façade works essentially reverse previous harmful alterations and serve to enhance the contribution the building makes to the Conservation Area.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.10 The proposals do not prejudice alternative future solutions or the building’s capacity to be adapted for its original use.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.11 The proposals are therefore consistent with the objectives as set out in local planning policy in terms of:

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS • Respecting surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS • Demonstrating how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings in relation to the conservation area.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 17

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS • Demonstrating how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the Conservation Area, and its wider setting in the light of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and area specific guidance notes.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.12

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The proposals are also consistent with the objectives set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (CLG, 2019. S16 Para185) specifically:

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS a. the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS b. the wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits that conservation of the historic environment can bring;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS c. the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness; and

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS d. opportunities to draw on the contribution made by the historic environment to the character of a place.

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 8.13

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS It is therefore recommended that the application is permitted subject to conditions set out in accordance with Paragraph 55 of the National Planning Policy Framework ensuring that they are:

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. necessary;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 2. relevant to planning and;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 3. to the development to be permitted;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 4. enforceable;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 5. precise and;

Text: 8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS reasonable in all other respects.
