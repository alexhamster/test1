Text: Comment Details Comment Reasons:

Text: Comment Details Comment:This property already has driveway access via i) an existing driveway off Ashley Rd and ii) a second access driveway off Bankhall Lane - that the applicant seems to have allowed neighbours to extend their garden into. Greenbelt should be preserved at all costs, a third driveway with what will no doubt result in new large gates, walls, lighting and security etc is unnecessary and unsightly destruction of the greenbelt.
