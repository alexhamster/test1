Text: 1. Introduction This Heritage Statement has been prepared by adapt heritage on behalf of the applicant in connection with a householder planning application for the partial demolition, extension and external alterations (the ‘Proposed Development’) at Park End, Dunham Town (the ‘Application Site’).

Text: 1. Introduction The Application Site is located within the south eastern section of the Dunham Town Conservation Area.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.2

Text: 1. Introduction Under Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council has a statutory duty to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of their conservation areas. The meaning of ‘preservation’ in this context, as informed by case law, is taken to be the avoidance of harm.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.3

Text: 1. Introduction The National Planning Policy Framework (‘NPPF’) (2021) provides the Government’s national planning policy on the conservation of the historic environment. In respect of information requirements for applications, Paragraph 194 states the following:

Text: 1. Introduction 1.4

Text: 1. Introduction “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.”1

Text: Context Context

Text: Context 2.1 The NPPF (2021) defines a heritage asset as:

Text: Context “A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest.”2

Text: Context 2.2 A site visit was undertaken in July 2022 to identify heritage assets with potential to be affected by the Proposed Development.

Text: Designated Heritage Assets Designated Heritage Assets

Text: Designated Heritage Assets 2.3 Designated heritage assets are those which possess a level of heritage interest that justifies designation under relevant legislation and are then subject to particular procedures in planning decisions that involve them.

Text: Overview of Historic Development 3.3 Below is an overview of the historic development of the Application Site and the surrounding area.

Text: Overview of Historic Development The village of ‘Donehame’ (Dunham) is first mentioned in the Domesday Book which indicates that the area was settled by at least the 11th century but with potential earlier origins.3 The growth of the village is inherently linked to the Dunham Massey Estate. The village of Dunham Town and the Manor of Dunham Massey were owned by the de Massey family during this time and up into the mid 14th century.4 After a succession of owners, the estate was passed to the Booth family who maintained ownership until the mid-18th century.

Text: Overview of Historic Development Ivy House, Big Tree House and other smaller domestic dwellings. Other additions include Dunham School (1759) and the construction of the Bridgewater Canal (1770s). The 1839 Tithe Map (Figure 3.4) shows many of these dwellings and various surrounding agricultural farmsteads. The parkland of Dunham Massey can be seen to the south. The Application Site itself consists of a rear outbuilding which served the Big Tree House.

Text: Overview of Historic Development 3.6

Text: Overview of Historic Development The accompanying apportionment (1839) confirms that the Application Site, and much of the surrounding area, was owned by the Earl of Stamford who resided at Dunham Massey. The site was partially occupied by Thomas Gibbon (to the front) and John Newton (to the rear).

Text: Overview of Historic Development 3.8

Text: Overview of Historic Development At some point between 1898 (Figure 3.6) and 1907 (Figure 3.7), the outbuilding on the Application Site was demolished and the grounds of Big Tree House shortened. A pair of semi-detached properties were constructed in its place, forming The Gables and Park End. The 1910 Ordnance Survey (Figure 3.7) shows the two buildings together with smaller outbuildings to the rear. There were few other changes to the surrounding area by the early 20th century.

Text: Significance and Special Interest Significance and Special Interest

Text: Significance and Special Interest The NPPF (2021) defines the significance of a heritage asset as:

Text: Significance and Special Interest “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”5

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation areas are designated on the basis of their special architectural or historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Historic England has revised and republished its guidance in respect of conservation areas which provides a framework for the appraisal and assessment of the special interest and significance of a conservation area.

Text: Special Character and Appearance Special Character and Appearance

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.5

Text: Special Character and Appearance The Dunham Town Conservation Area and its immediate environs are predominantly rural and agricultural in character, with strong connections to the Dunham Massey Estate. The conservation area includes the original early 18th century Walled Kitchen Garden of Dunham Massey and the parkland forms the southern boundary of the area.

Text: Special Character and Appearance Figure 4.1: Houses to Woodhouse Lane (July 2022)

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.6 The conservation area is principally centred on three areas; Woodhouse Lane (Figures 4.1 and 4.2) and School Lane which are typically domestic in

Text: Special Character and Appearance character with a mix of terraced and detached buildings set within mature plots. The other area is the Walled Kitchen Garden which forms a large area of open space to the western part of the conservation area, albeit enclosed by tall brick boundary walling.

Text: Special Character and Appearance Figure 4.2: Houses to Woodhouse Lane (July 2022)

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.7

Text: Special Character and Appearance The conservation area is characterised by residential use with a mix of modest terraced cottages, larger detached houses with agricultural farmsteads to the outer edges. They principally date to the 18th and 19th centuries and were historically interspersed with supporting communal buildings such as public houses, post office, schools and places of worship. A number of these buildings have since been converted into residential use.

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.8

Text: Special Character and Appearance The majority of the buildings in the Dunham Town Conservation Area are two storeys and built from red brick with slate roofing. Some properties are rendered and some have been refaced at a later date. According to the Council Appraisal, many of the properties in the area may have originally been white-washed.6 Detailing is relatively restrained and restricted to the larger dwellings such as the Red House with its quoined entrance and gabled pediment. Later buildings in the conservation area, principally from the late 19th century, incorporate a mix of render and red brick with areas of timber patterning.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Summary of Special Interest

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.11 The special character and appearance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area is summarised within the Council Appraisal as:

Text: Summary of Special Interest “The special interest and heritage value of the Dunham Town Conservation Area and the boundary extensions stems primarily from its close links with the Dunham Massey estate, significant parts of which are located within the boundaries of the Conservation Area. Dunham Town has been a testing ground for Dunham Massey improvement initiatives since the 18 th century, most notably as a traditional estate village providing estate workers with homes. The establishment of workers’ accommodation in the village has culminated in a distinctive scale and architectural style, which is especially important for its group impact.”7

Text: Summary of Special Interest 12

Text: Summary of Special Interest Contribution made by the Application Site to the Significance of Dunham Town Conservation Area

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.12 As set out earlier at Section 3, the Application Site originally formed part of the grounds of Big Tree House and partially included an outbuilding that fronted Charcoal Lane. This was demolished and replaced by the present semi-detached houses between 1898 and 1907 known as Park End and The Gables.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.7: Front Elevation to Park End (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.13 Park End is built from red pressed brick to the ground floor with pebbledash render to the first floor with brick quoining detail. The windows are timber casements with a bay window at ground floor. The roof is pitched and constructed from slate with clay ridge tiles. The shared gable has simple timber detailing. There is a central and an off-centre chimneystack to the rear of the building.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.14 In the late 20th century, the original open timber porch has been removed and enclosed with modern brick. A two storey flat roofed extension was added to Park End around the same time and is built from similar materials (red brick/pebbledash) with a small garage door and window above.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.8: Rear Elevation to Park End (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.15 The rear of the building (Figure 4.8) is similar in its design although with a small pedimented gable with simple detailing. At ground floor is a single storey flat roofed modern extension which appears to have been added at the late 20th or early 21st century.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.16 The immediate garden area includes a separate a small brick outbuilding (Figure 4.8) with slate roof and clay ridge tiles which is believed to be contemporary with the date of the building (1898-1907). It includes a door and two window openings.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.10: View from Dunham Massey Tennis Club (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.17 The Council Appraisal identifies various buildings which make a positive contribution towards the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation area. The Application Site has not been identified as part of this process.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.18 In terms of contribution, Park End is typical in its use of materials and employs a standard design from the turn of the century. It is not the work of an architect or designer of note and is not of landmark quality. The building also does not respond to the typical detailing of the conservation area. The building and wider plot is largely screened from much of the conservation area due to its setback position and the mature planting to its boundaries (Figure 4.6). There are filtered views from Charcoal Road (Figure 4.9) and distant and partially obscured views from the Dunham Massey Tennis Club (Figure 4.10).

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.19 When considering the significance of the area and the contribution made by the existing building on the Application Site, it is considered to make a neutral contribution towards the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Summary of Legislation and National Planning Policy

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.1 Under Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council, in determining the submitted full planning application, has a statutory duty to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of their conservation areas. The meaning of ‘preservation’ in this context, as informed by case law, is taken to be the avoidance of harm.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.2

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.3 Paragraph 198 requires when considering the impact of development on the significance of a designated heritage asset that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation. ‘Conservation’ is defined by the NPPF as ‘the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance.’8

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraphs 201 and 202 differentiate between ‘substantial’ and ‘less than substantial harm’ and provide a framework for the consideration of harm to the significance of designated heritage assets where it arises, bearing in mind the considerable importance and weight that must be given to the statutory duties of the 1990 Act.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment DLUHC (2021) National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) – Annex 2: Glossary

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.5 Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas, to enhance or better reveal their significance.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.6 Paragraph 207 states that not all elements of a Conservation Area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area should be treated either as substantial harm or less than substantial harm, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area as a whole.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.7 Further details of the heritage legislation, planning policy and guidance for consideration of the Proposed Development is set out in in Appendix 1.

Text: The Proposed Development The Proposed Development

Text: The Proposed Development 5.8 The Proposed Development consists of a full planning application for the partial demolition, extension and external alterations to the existing building at Park End, Dunham Town. This includes:

Text: The Proposed Development • Extension: Demolition of modern extension and replacement with single storey new extension, incorporating the existing outbuilding.

Text: The Proposed Development • External Alterations: Construction of a pitched roof to existing two storey extension and reinstatement of open timber porch.

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment 5.10

Text: Impact Assessment This impact assessment employs national advice provided by Historic England as an appropriate framework for analysis, including Historic Environment Good Practice Advice (GPA) in Planning Note 2: Managing Significance in Decision Taking in the Historic Environment (2015), which sets out the importance of good design and response to local distinctiveness for new development in the historic environment. This advice provides a checklist of factors that may influence what will make the scale, height, massing, alignment, materials and proposed use of new development successful in its context.

Text: Proposed Extension Proposed Extension

Text: Proposed Extension 5.11 The Proposed Development involves a number of works to Park End as part of its continued use as a private residential dwelling. The proposals involve the demolition of a modern single storey flat roofed extension at the rear of the building (added in the late 20th century) and its replacement with a new extension (Figure 5.1).

Text: Proposed Extension Figure 5.1: Existing and Proposed Rear Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed Extension 5.12 The proposed extension involves retaining the original outbuilding at the rear, utilising the location of the existing extension and infilling the small

Text: Proposed Extension area in-between. It is single storey and includes a pitched gable and is to be constructed from white render (Figures 5.1 and 5.2).

Text: Proposed Extension 5.13

Text: Proposed Extension The design of the extension has been influenced by the main house and outbuilding, referencing their pitched gables whilst responding to their overall scale and form. The materials, including the use of render and slate, responds to those found to Park End and within the wider conservation area. This helps create a modern yet contextual extension that responds to its context. The openings adopt a more modern aesthetic with large areas of glazing with aluminium surrounds.

Text: Proposed Extension Figure 5.2: Existing and Proposed Side Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed Extension 5.14 The Council Appraisal states the following at Paragraph 4.7.28 in relation to Development Opportunities:

Text: Proposed Extension “Where houses are located on a generous surrounding plot there may be some scope for modest extension providing it does not overpower the main block of the house. Such extensions are evident on some properties throughout the Conservation Area. The densely compacted plots of the cottages on the west side of Woodhouse Lane render these buildings less capable of extension.”

Text: Proposed Extension 5.15 Minor changes are proposed to the outbuilding including replacing the existing modern door and dropping a cill to create two larger windows constructed from aluminium. The existing side modern window is also proposed to be replaced with aluminium.

Text: Proposed Extension 16

Text: Proposed Extension 5.16

Text: Proposed Extension The Proposed Development will not harm or diminish the contribution made by the existing building and Application Site to the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area. The proposed extension replaces an existing one and is subservient in scale and massing to the original building. It accords with the Council Appraisal and maintains a generous plot whilst allowing for a contextual modest extension. The new extension will also not disrupt any principal views to or from Park End. This includes from Charcoal Road and the Dunham Massey Tennis Club.

Text: Proposed External Alterations Proposed External Alterations

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.17 The Proposed Development involves a number of alterations to the front and rear elevations. A new pitched roof is proposed to the existing flat roofed extension which responds to the character and style of the existing building and the existing extension to the neighbouring The Gables. It is proposed to be constructed from slate and clay ridge tiles as per the original roof.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.18 A number of other changes are proposed including the removal of the modern garage door at ground floor and window to the first floor (both within the later extension) and their replacement with matching 3-light timber casement windows (Figure 5.3). The detail of this is to be agreed via condition. These works will maintain the overall character and appearance of Park End.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.19 The Proposed Development involves the reinstatement of the original porch arrangement with timber posts and structure with small brick supporting wall. A new timber external door is also proposed. The designs of both of these are based upon those found at the neighbouring The Gables.

Text: Proposed External Alterations Figure 5.3: Existing and Proposed Front Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.20 As illustrated at Figures 5.1 and 5.2, the Proposed Development involves minimal alterations to the rear and side elevation of the building with the exception of the proposed replacement extension and windows. The only other works are the alteration and replacement of some windows/door openings (with matching timber) to the later two storey extension. The arrangement and design of these are to match the main building and will help improve its overall appearance.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.21 As set out above, the Proposed Development will not harm or diminish the contribution made by the existing building and Application Site to the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area. The proposals present an opportunity to remove negative additions and reinstate lost original architectural features to the main building. This has the ability to improve the contribution made by the existing building to the significance of the conservation area,

Text: Heritage Legislation, Planning Policy and Guidance Below is an overview of the relevant heritage legislation, national and local planning policy and supplementary planning documents and guidance.

Text: Legislation Legislation

Text: Legislation The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 Under Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council has a statutory duty to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of their conservation areas. The meaning of ‘preservation’ in this context, as informed by case law, is taken to be the avoidance of harm.

Text: Legislation The concept of ‘preserve’ has been interpreted through case law to mean ‘to cause no harm’.

Text: National Planning Policy National Planning Policy

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) The National Planning Policy Framework (2021)

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) requires that great weight is given to the conservation of designated heritage assets and this reflects the statutory duty of the 1990 Act with respect to listed buildings and conservation areas. Conservation is defined by the NPPF as “the process of maintaining and managing change to heritage assets in ways that sustain and where appropriate, enhance their significance.”9

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 197 of the NPPF elaborates that local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 198 requires when considering the impact of a Proposed Development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation and the more important the asset, the greater that weight should be. Significance can be harmed or lost through alteration or destruction of the heritage asset or development within its setting. As heritage assets are irreplaceable, any harm or loss requires clear and convincing justification.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 201 states that where a Proposed Development will lead to substantial harm to or total loss of significance of a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent, unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm and or loss is necessary to achieve substantial benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following apply:

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) “the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) • no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) • conservation by grant-funding or some form of charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use”

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 202 requires that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) 21

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimum viable use.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas, to enhance or better reveal their significance.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 207 states that not all elements of a Conservation Area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area should be treated either as substantial harm under paragraph 201 or less than substantial harm under paragraph 202, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area as a whole.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Whilst not planning policy the Planning Practice Guidance provides a clear indication of the Government’s approach to the application of national policy contained in the NPPF. Where there is conflict between the guidance in the PPG and earlier documents the PPG will take precedence.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Historic England Advice Note 1: Conservation Area Appraisal, Designation and Management (2019)

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 The guidance provides information on conservation area appraisal, designation and management to assist in implementing historic environment legislation, planning policy and guidance The guidance states that change is inevitable, and often beneficial, and this advice sets out ways to manage change in a way that conserves and enhances the character and appearance of historic areas. Conservation areas can contribute to sustainable development in all its three dimensions as outlined in the NPPF.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Historic England Advice Note 2: Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment (2015)

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 This note is not a statement of Government policy but supports the implementation of national government policy. It provides advice on assessing the significance of heritage assets and the impact of proposals on that significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Historic England Advice Note 12: Statements of Heritage Significance: Analysing Significance in Heritage Assets (2019)

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 The guidance covers the NPPF requirement for applicants for heritage and other consents to describe heritage significance to help local planning authorities to make decisions on the impact of proposals for change to heritage assets. Understanding the significance of heritage assets, in advance of developing proposals for their buildings and sites, enables owners and applicants to receive effective, consistent and timely decisions. The advice note explores the assessment of significance of heritage assets as part of a staged approach to decision-making in which assessing significance precedes designing the proposal(s).
