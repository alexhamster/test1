Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: 1.1 Background 1.1 Background

Text: 1.1 Background Kingdom Ecology have carried out a badger survey of an area of disused land located at a disused house at Turpin’s Hollow, Dunham Road, Bowdon, Trafford, WA14 3LN CW12 3DY (National Grid reference SJ 7466 8617). The area of land measures approximately 0.6ha in area.

Text: 1.1 Background Full planning approval (102734/FUL/20) for a replacement dwelling was granted in 2021 with a badger survey required to satisfy a condition on the decision notice. The condition states the following:

Text: 1.1 Background ‘No development or works of site preparation shall take place until a survey, undertaken by a suitably qualified person, to determine the presence of badgers within the application site has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. If any badgers are found to either reside or forage within the site, no development shall take place until a method statement giving details of measures to be taken to avoid any possible harm to badgers during the course of the development has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the approved protection / mitigation measures shall thereafter be fully implemented for the duration of construction works.’

Text: 1.1 Background A badger survey of the site was therefore undertaken on the 27th January 2022. Survey was completed by Richard Roe (BSc, MSc, MIEEM, CEnv). Richard has extensive experience of undertaking badger surveys as a professional ecological consultant with over twenty years’ experience and has held several badger development licences.

Text: 1.1 Background Survey examined the proposed development site and adjacent habitats where accessible.

Text: 1.2 Legislation 1.2 Legislation

Text: 1.2.1 Badgers 1.2.1 Badgers

Text: 1.2.1 Badgers Badgers are afforded protection under the Protection of Badgers Act (PBA) 1992; this act was introduced on welfare grounds. The Act is based primarily on the need to protect badgers from baiting and deliberate harm or injury. Badgers are not considered to be a species of any conservation concern.

Text: 1.2.1 Badgers 2

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report However the Act contains restrictions that apply more widely and can have implications were badgers and development come into conflict. All the following are considered criminal offences:

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report to wilfully kill, injure, take, possess or cruelly ill-treat a badger;

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report to attempt to do so; or

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report • to intentionally or recklessly interfere with a sett.

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report Sett interference includes damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing access to a sett, and disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett. It is not illegal, and therefore a licence is not required, to carry out disturbing activities in the vicinity of a sett if no badger is disturbed and the sett is not damaged or obstructed.

Text: Turpin’s Hollow Badger Report The legislation recognises the need for a range of legitimate activities to be carried out and allows licences to be granted for certain purposes permitting work that would otherwise be illegal, including development. Badger licences are project specific and cannot be issued until full planning permission has been granted. The authority responsible for the issuing of licenses is Natural England.

Text: 2.1 Survey Methods 2.1 Survey Methods

Text: 2.1.1 Survey Aims and Objectives 2.1.1 Survey Aims and Objectives

Text: 2.1.1 Survey Aims and Objectives Survey comprised of a site visit and inspection of the proposed development site. The survey aim was to assess the site as to its suitability to support badgers.

Text: 2.1.1 Survey Aims and Objectives Survey also aimed to inform potential mitigation measures if required to ameliorate any negative impacts attributable to the proposed works.

Text: 2.1.2 Badger Survey 2.1.2 Badger Survey

Text: 2.1.2 Badger Survey The badger survey examined all semi-natural habitats within the study area. Survey followed methodologies given in Harris et al. (1989 ). All linear features such as hedgerows, fence lines and drainage ditches were walked and searched for evidence of badgers. Suitable sett habitat such as scrub and woodland were also actively searched for badger field signs, where accessible. Badger field signs include prints, latrines, foraging signs, snagged hair or badger setts. Surveys were undertaken on 27th January 2022.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description 2.2.1 Site Description

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description The site is located adjacent at Turpins Hollow on the busy A56 Dunham Road. Proposals are to construct a replacement dwelling at the site.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description Habitats to the north of the site comprise of open arable land. The River Bollin is located approximately 150m to the south of the site. There are extensive areas of broadleaved woodland running along the River Bollin. These nearby woodland habitats offer high suitability habitat for badger setts.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description The development site itself is located within the former gardens of a derelict house. The western boundary of the site faces on to Dunham Road, this boundary comprises of a row of oak and ash trees. A hawthorn and holly hedgerow runs along the northern and eastern boundaries of the site. The northern boundary of the site includes a 2- 3m wide strip of dense bramble scrub with scattered young and semi- mature ash and holly running along the boundary hedge. There are rabbit burrows along the northern boundary with signs of rabbit foraging activity around the site.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description The derelict house is located on the southern boundary of the site. There is a row of Heras fencing running along the southern site boundary which divides the site from an adjacent active construction

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description site. The eastern boundary of the site has an opening in the hedgerow which leads into the adjacent arable field.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description The majority of the site comprises of short sward grassland of amenity origin and patches of bare ground. Species present within the grassland and the adjacent bramble scrub habitats include cleavers, nettle, , cow parsley, greater burdock, pendulous sedge, creeping buttercup, broad leaved dock, and common ragwort. There are also scattered trees around the derelict house including mature oak, cypress and semi- mature and young ash.

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description No badger setts or other field signs indicative of badger activity were found at the site

Text: 2.2.1 Site Description Photographs of habitats recorded at the site are shown in the Appendix.

Text: Recommendations Recommendations

Text: Recommendations 3

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation 3.1 Summary and Evaluation

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation No badger setts or badger field signs were identified within or immediately adjacent to the proposed development site.

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation However, badger setts are likely to be present within nearby habitats in the surrounding landscape and therefore there is a low risk that badgers could be harmed during construction if works are carried out in an insensitive manner. It is therefore recommended that during construction:

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation • Where any trenches or other excavations are to be left open overnight these should be fitted with mammal ramps or should have the sides battered to form a slope to allow badgers to escape.

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation • A tidy works area should be maintained during construction and any hazardous substances would be fenced off to remove any badger hazards from the site.

Text: 3.1 Summary and Evaluation Following the implementation of these measures, it is considered to be very unlikely that the proposed development will have any significant negative impact upon the local badger population.
