Text: Site Context Site Context

Text: Site Context 2. The Site

Text: Site Context 2.1. The application site is located within the field to the south of the dwelling at 299 Ashley Road.

Text: Site Context 2.2. The wider site (299 Ashley Road) is located on the edge of the settlement of Hale, accessed from Ashley Road and bounded by large detached dwellings to the north and the alignment of the Manchester-Chester railway line.

Text: Site Context 2.3. The property transitions from the northern urban development moving south through the formal garden and pond to the rural southern field where the application site lies.

Text: Site Context 2.4. A shared driveway provides access to no’s 295, 297 and 299 Ashley Road (as approved ref. H/48731). The shared access is grass-crete construction leading from Ashley Road to the main entrance gate at no.299 Ashley Road.

Text: Site Context 2.5. There is currently a temporary construction access on site as approved within the original replacement dwelling permission, reference 97561/FUL/19. The construction access was permitted to mitigate potential damage and disturbance along the shared access and to support the increase of construction vehicles on site.

Text: Site Context 2.6. The application site wholly covers the construction access which is located within the Green Belt and open countryside.

Text: Planning History Planning History

Text: Planning History 2.7. The land within the application site forms part of the property at 299 Ashley and has been subject to Full Planning permission for a replacement dwelling and since been subject to several amendments and discharge of conditions, including a Section 73 application, reference 102088/VAR/20, approved in May 2021.

Text: Planning History 2.8. As mentioned, a temporary construction access was permitted under ref. 97561/FUL/19 with a condition which required the temporary access to be closed and restored prior to occupation of the replacement dwelling.

Text: Planning History 2.9. A subsequent non material amendment application was approved in May 2022 to extend the presence of the construction access road until December 2022 to enable the occupiers to move into the property whilst construction work continues.

Text: Planning History 2.10. In parallel with this application, a further non material amendment application has been submitted for tweaks to the alignment of fencing and gates. The non material amendment proposes to reposition the field gate to the southern field to a more suitable location and would remain unchanged/in the same position in this application if considered acceptable.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3. Proposed Development

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.1. This application seeks permission for engineering operations within the southern field of the property. The new private way will serve as a new access for the detached dwelling at 299 Ashley Road.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.2. The private way will be connected to the existing shared entrance where it leads from Ashley Road and will follow the existing construction access layout up to the main entrance gates of 299 Ashley Road.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.3. The construction access currently comprises gravel which will be reused where possible with a central grass verge planted. Photographs of similar designs are illustrated on the supporting Proposed Site Plan, reference 17237 (PL) 060 Rev C and in Figure 1 opposite.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.4. On completion of the new private way, the use of the shared access between 297 Ashley Road and the main entrance of 299 Ashley Road will be retained as a secondary access should that be needed.

Text: 3. Proposed Development 3.5. The need for this access has stemmed from the need to enhance security across the site (details provided to officers under separate cover), but delivers additional benefits as outlined in this report, included to neighbours in the form of enhanced appearance/outlook and amenity.

Text: Planning Assessment 5.1. The Development Plan is the starting point for decision making as required by Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Proposals that accord with an up-to-date Development Plan should be granted without delay.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.2. The creation of a private way will provide a new access to be used by the occupiers of no.299 Ashley Road and for visitors and deliveries to the site.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.3. The functionality of the private way will be twofold, providing access to the southern rural field for maintenance as well as access to the property to the north.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.4. Paragraph 150 within the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) identifies engineering operations to not be inappropriate development in the Green Belt provided they preserve its openness.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.5. The test is therefore whether the private way impact openness. To address this the drawings demonstrate the private way would be designed to appear as a rural-like track with a central grass verge without formal edging or kerbs. The private way will blend into the landscape once the grass verge is matured and will not be visible from the surrounding areas.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.6. The mature belt of vegetation that follows the River Bollin screens views from the south. Similarly, views from the north and west will

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location be predominantly screened by mature vegetation and housing and the railway line will screen views from the east.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.7. A similar proposal nearby (Mobberley - albeit Cheshire East) for an additional access drive within the Green Belt at Owen House Farm, reference 14/1516M was allowed at appeal. The Inspector agreed and confirmed the engineering works are not inappropriate and would preserve the openness of the Green Belt. The Inspector noted specifically that the central grass strip would assist helping the private way to blend into the open countryside/landscape. As such, the Inspector considered the proposal would not be inappropriate development in the Green Belt and granted planning permission.

Text: Acceptability of a Private Way in this Location 5.8. We consider the proposed engineering works are considered appropriate in the Green Belt and will not impact the openness of the Green Belt due to the modest nature and careful design to integrate the proposal into the landscape. The proposal is in accordance with Core Strategy policy R4, ‘saved’ UDP policy C4 and the Framework.

Text: Appropriate Design Appropriate Design

Text: Appropriate Design 5.9. The proposed private way has been designed to resemble a rural track with a central grass verge.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.10. The grass verge has been included within the design to enhance biodiversity and to sensitively implement the private way into the rural southern field.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.11. The private way will utilise the current construction access to provide formal vehicle access to the southern rural field and to the

Text: Appropriate Design 12

Text: Appropriate Design main entrance gate of the property for the occupier, visitors, maintenance, and delivery drivers.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.12. The way has been designed to follow the alignment of the temporary construction access but to considerably reduce its width and the amount of hardstanding, implementing soft landscaping to minimise its visibility. The private way will follow the temporary construction access to utilise works that have already taken place, sustainably reusing material wherever possible.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.13. As mentioned, Appeal decision for Cheshire East application 14/1516M for an access drive was considered by the Inspector to not be urbanising or unduly harmful to the rural landscape. Similar, this current proposal for a new private way has been designed to sympathetically blend into the rural landscape and incorporates a central grass verge which will not be urbanising and will be appropriate in the rural location.

Text: Appropriate Design 5.14. The private way will have a sympathetic design and is in accordance with Core Strategy Policy L7, R2 and R4, and ‘saved’ UDP policies C4 and ENV17.

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations Wider Benefits and Considerations

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations 5.15. Engineering works within the Green Belt are not considered inappropriate development where it does not adversely impact the openness of the Green Belt, as such we do not consider that Very Special Circumstance are required.

Text: Wider Benefits and Considerations 5.16. However, if officers take a different view, Very Special Circumstances exist in the form of the need for improved security, impact to mature trees and impact to the amenity of neighbouring residents.

Text: Security Security

Text: Security 5.17. A separate letter is submitted to provide a robust justification for the need to improve security on site. We kindly request that these letters remain strictly private and confidential and are only viewed internal to inform the Planning Officers’ assessment.

Text: Security 5.18. The requirements and justification outlined in the attached letters in our view remain relevant should the occupier change.

Text: Trees Trees

Text: Trees 5.19. The proposal will not impact any of the existing and approved vegetation and landscaping, as permitted by reference 106614/CND/21.

Text: Trees 5.20. The supporting Veteran & Ancient Tree Report prepared by Chris Allen Cert Arb, a Professional Tree Inspector undertook an assessment of the mature trees located adjacent to the shared access have been identified as an ancient Oak (T1), veteran Oak (T2), and a future veteran Oak (T3).

Text: Trees 13

Text: Trees 5.21. The report highlights T3 lies outside of the application site, however due to its potential to become a veteran, it should be included in the consideration of mitigation and protection.

Text: Trees 5.22. To protect the vitality of the trees, the report concludes the temporary construction access has provided a one-off opportunity to consider the implementation of a new access which will alleviate compaction and root restricting issues of the trees.

Text: Trees 5.23. The occupier and visitors will cease to use the shared access on a regular basis once the private way is implemented which will lessen the usage of the shared access, supporting the longevity of the veteran and ancient trees.

Text: Trees 5.24. If Very Special Circumstances are applied to the assessment of the proposed private way, it is considered that the new access will have the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of the veteran trees and will not impact any trees on site.

Text: Trees 5.25. The proposal is in accordance with Paragraph 174 of the Framework, Core Strategy Policy R2 and ‘saved’ UDP Policy ENV13.

Text: Living Conditions and Amenity Living Conditions and Amenity

Text: Living Conditions and Amenity 5.26. The proposed private way will be located away from the existing shared access. As an additional benefit, the new access will mitigate any disturbance caused from vehicular movements by the occupiers, visitors, deliveries and night time security checks, improving neighbouring amenity in accordance with Core Strategy Policy L7.

Text: Flood Risk Flood Risk

Text: Flood Risk 5.27. In accordance with ‘saved’ UDP policy ENV13, the private way will not alter the existing levels on site and will be wholly permeable. As such, the private way will not increase the risk of flooding on site and its surrounds.

Text: Introduction Introduction

Text: Introduction I am Chris Allen, a certified Arborist & Tree Inspector within the commercial sector with 20 years’ experience. I am a member of the Arb Association (AA), Royal Forestry Society (RFS), Ancient Tree Forum (ATF) and the Forestry Industry Safety Accord (FISA). I have worked on jobs as diverse as nuclear power stations to Manchester Town Hall.

Text: The Brief The Brief

Text: The Brief I have been asked by Wright Landscapes to comment on two Oaks, one of which is classified as veteran and the other as ancient, located within the 7-acre boundary of 299 Ashley Road with a view to providing a management solution for their immediate and future protection.

Text: The Purpose of the Report The Purpose of the Report

Text: The Purpose of the Report The purpose of this report is to help prolong the life of these trees and ensure the continuity of habitat required by many of their associated species.

Text: Classification Classification

Text: Classification Ancient Tree Guide No.4 (ATF, 2008) defines an ancient tree as one “that has passed beyond maturity and is old, or aged in comparison with other trees of the same species”. Similarly, according to current guidance for use in the Ancient Tree Hunt (Owen & Alderman, 2008), an ancient tree is one that has all or most of the following characteristics;

Text: Classification 1. Biological, aesthetic or cultural interest because of its great age.

Text: Classification 2. A growth stage that is described as ancient or post-mature.

Text: Classification 3. A chronological age that is old relative to others of the same species.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal Conclusions/Proposal

Text: Conclusions/Proposal Having identified a veteran, an ancient and a future veteran Oak on the site means we should take on the responsibility of their management. If we can offer a simple solution to reduce some of the stresses the trees are suffering then this opportunity must be taken.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal As detailed later in this report, the main issue with the trees is allowing them space to thrive and to prevent/alleviate soil compaction. A temporary access road has been constructed away from the trees to facilitate the redevelopment of 299 Ashley Road. The new temporary access road has presented us with a one-off opportunity to permanently move the road away from the trees alleviating the compaction and root restricting issues. This act will future proof them for the generations to come. The existing road should be removed after the driveway of 297 Ashley Road to allow sufficient rooting area. A new road should extend the short distance from the driveway across the field to allow for a circular access to prevent vehicles attempting to turn around on the root plate.

Text: Conclusions/Proposal As the temporary access road is on land classified as green belt an application for its permanent status should be submitted to Trafford LPA .

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development Ancientness in Relation to Development

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development The developmental characteristics that tend to develop with increasing age in trees include the following;

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 1. A large girth.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 2. The progressive narrowing of successive annual increments in the stem.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 3. The aging and associated decay leading to the hollowing of the central stem.

Text: Ancientness in Relation to Development 4. Changes to crown architecture.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Tree Health & Soil Compaction

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Oak trees host a multitude of organisms which have evolved with the trees over thousands of years, whilst some may feast upon the tissues of the tree itself, they tend not to result in the death of the tree and we classify these life forms as associates, so there is a balance where no one species has the upper hand. I am not talking about foreign pathogens that sweep the country which is a separate issue. If the tree suffers stresses from either biotic or abiotic factors then the balance can be tipped against the tree which could lead to its decline and death.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction Trees require trace elements for all of their physiological functions and these are obtained from within the soil, the fine roots grow through the soil depleting resources then growing into new areas. The roots also respire CO2 which diffuses out of the soil and is replaced by oxygen, this process is called gaseous exchange. Compaction of the soil reduces the soil pore space, gaseous exchange and available water, the tree then produces large amounts of ethanol which stops root growth.

Text: Tree Health & Soil Compaction The compacted soil is causing these trees to decline from the lack of access to new trace elements and available water.

Text: Soil Density Probe Soil Density Probe

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 01; showing the three separate areas which had the soil density probe.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 02

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 03

Text: Soil Density Probe A soil density probe was used to measure the compaction of the soil.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 01: The roadway has approximately 450mm of hardcore underneath it with a plastic support mat. The probe wasn’t able to penetrate.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 02: Multiple areas within the grassed area around the tree were tested and all locations registered no compaction.

Text: Soil Density Probe Photograph 03: The field area on the right has had plant machinery driving over it resulting in the soil compacting so the water cannot drain away. The probe registered compaction resistance at 75mm.

Text: The Trees The Trees

Text: The Trees Looking at all three trees from a distance we can see from the crowns that T1 is in a healthier condition than T2 and T3, with T3 overall being in a worse condition even though this tree is significantly younger. T3 is surrounded by compacted substrate.

Text: The Trees Making improvements to the soil on this site would significantly increase the trees resilience, vigour and vitality.

Text: The Trees T1 Oak has a girth of 6.05m making it an ancient tree. The existing live tissue is functional with healthy vitality. There is epicormic growth which is an indication of vigour. There is plenty of leaf mould within the trunk to support rare species and a large amount of habitat. There is deadwood in the canopy and on the floor. Historically the left side stem has failed though regrowth is present.

Text: The Trees Habitat photographs

Text: The Trees T2 Oak has a girth of 5m making it a veteran tree. The base and trunk are ivy covered so the base could not be assessed. There is more deadwood in the upper canopy and it is showing some signs of decline.

Text: The Trees T3 Oak. This tree is within the boundary of 297 Ashley Road so is not technically part of the report. It is very much in need of being included as this has the potential of becoming a future veteran and therefore its importance should not be understated. The continuity of the landscape is as equally important as the ancient trees. The girth is approximately 800mm and as previously stated is in decline due to the compaction of the substrate. Separate provisions for this tree will follow after consultation with the owner.

Text: Principles for Protection Principles for Protection

Text: Principles for Protection The aim is that there should be no further avoidable loss of ancient trees and to maintain a tree population in which values associated with ancientness are sustained.

Text: Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees

Text: Decline in Veteran and Ancient trees It's important to understand how we view the term ‘decline’ as an organism that lives for hundreds of years may go through periods of decline and regrowth and we would not necessarily see this unless historic photographs exist. The focus should be on providing the best solution to enable its longevity and we can only achieve this by giving trees space for the roots to grow.

Text: How much space How much space

Text: How much space Under the existing British Standard 5837;2012 Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction-Recommendations. It is recommended that a root protection area (RPA) is 10 x the diameter of the stem whereas with veteran trees it is 15 x the diameter of the stem, so a rough guide of a 6m girth tree is a diameter of 2m x 15 = 30m, obviously we are nowhere near having the correct RPA. By allowing the temporary access road to become permanent It will open up a large area of soil giving an opportunity to improve the trees chances of the survival.

Text: How much space The LPA have issued permission for a temporary road to be installed to facilitate the redevelopment.

Text: How much space It is reasonable to conclude that this temporary road should be retained as the main entrance to 299, therefore allowing the removal of the existing old road that passes over the root plates of the two trees. The this will give both trees the soil volume and space that they require. Failure to act could lead to the loss of both trees due to restricted rooting area.

Text: How much space It is recommended that the road directly outside of the gates of 297 is extended a small distance across the field to join up with the new road to allow for ease of access and to stop vehicles driving over the root plate when turning around.

Text: How much space The distance from the stem of T1 to the old road is 4m and to the new road is 24m, this additional gain of rooting zone will be sufficient to increase both trees resilience to climate change and any damage from increased traffic during the build. After the removal of road way, a soil density test should be carried out.

Text: Additional Works Additional Works

Text: Additional Works Pruning works would only be recommended on safety issues or that failure to prune could result in a catastrophic stem failure. The Ivy on T2 should be severed at the base and removed up to 1m off the ground for a basal inspection, the Ivy should be allowed to naturally die off then a re-inspection of the upper stem to check for any safety issues.

Text: Additional Info Additional Info

Text: Additional Info The owner from 297 Ashley Road was spoken with when I visited the site, and he has agreed that it is a reasonable proposition.

Text: Land use & Mitigation Land use & Mitigation

Text: Land use & Mitigation The site would lend itself to the recent popular revival of Medieval pasture land with 15% tree cover and it would support around 5 cow/calves.
