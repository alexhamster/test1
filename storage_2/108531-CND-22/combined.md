Text: 1. Appeals to the Secretary of State If you are aggrieved by the decision of your local planning authority to refuse permission for the proposed development or to grant it subject to conditions, then you can appeal to the Secretary of State under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

Text: 1. Appeals to the Secretary of State If you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision then you must do so within 6 months of the date of this notice. However, if this is a decision to refuse planning permission and an enforcement notice has been served for the same or very similar development the time limit is:

Text: 1. Appeals to the Secretary of State Within 28 days from the date of the local planning authority’s decision if the enforcement notice was served before the decision was made yet not longer than 2 years before the application was made.

Text: 1. Appeals to the Secretary of State Within 28 days from the date the enforcement notice was served if served on or after the date the decision was made (unless this extends the normal appeal period).

Text: Appeals can be made online at: https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate. The Secretary of State can allow a longer period for giving notice of an appeal, but he will not normally be prepared to use this power unless there are special circumstances which excuse the delay in giving notice of appeal.

Text: Appeals can be made online at: https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate. The Secretary of State need not consider an appeal if it seems to him that the local planning authority could not have granted planning permission for the proposed development or could not have granted it without the conditions they imposed, having regard to the statutory requirements, to the provisions of any development order and to any directions given under a development order. In practice, the Secretary of State does not refuse to consider appeals solely because the local Planning Authority based their decision on a direction given by him.

Text: Appeals can be made online at: https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate. If you intend to submit an appeal that you would like examined by inquiry then you must notify the Local Planning Authority and Planning Inspectorate (inquiryappeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk) at least 10 days before submitting the appeal. Further details are on GOV.UK.

Text: Executive summary. Executive summary.

Text: Executive summary. Hoare Lea has conducted an environmental noise survey for the proposed Homesense Store at Unit 4, Altrincham Retail Park in Altrincham.

Text: Executive summary. The following summarises the assessment procedure and findings contained within this report:

Text: Executive summary. – Unattended noise monitoring was conducted throughout a typical four-day period.

Text: Executive summary. – Background noise levels typical of the period in which the proposed plant will be in operation have been measured and used to define building services plant noise emission limits at the nearest noise sensitive receptors.

Text: Executive summary. – The nearest noise sensitive receptors have been identified as existing residential dwellings along Princess Street and Peveril Road to the north of the proposed store.

Text: Executive summary. – It is understood that the store opening hours are 0900 to 2000 Monday to Saturday and 1000 to 1800 on Sundays, and that the proposed building services plant will operate for a maximum of an hour before the store opens and after the store closes (0800 to 2100 Monday to Saturday and 0900 to 1900 on Sunday).

Text: Executive summary. – During the time in which the plant will be operational, the combined building services plant noise emission contribution limit advised is 31 dB(A), one metre from the nearest noise sensitive receptor.

Text: Executive summary. – An assessment of noise associated with the proposed items of building services plant has been undertaken. The predicted noise level exceeds the defined noise emission limit by up to 16 dB(A). As such, noise control measures of the air handling unit and condenser units is required.

Text: Executive summary. – In order to provide sufficient attenuation of the proposed plant, a solid screen at least 0.5m higher than the height of condenser units 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 and 06 once on their anti-vibration mounts (approximately 2m high) is required. The solid screen is required to prevent a direct line of sight between the condenser units and the residential receptors on Princess Street and Peveril Road.

Text: Executive summary. – In addition, in order to provide sufficient attenuation of the supply and exhaust fan of the air handling unit, a silencer of length 600mm and free area 50% and 33% is required respectively.

Text: Executive summary. – Incorporation of these mitigation measures is sufficient to provide noise emissions in compliance with the defined noise emission limit and the requirements of Planning Condition 4.

Text: 2.1 Local noise environment. The surrounding noise climate is predominantly formed of distant road traffic noise from the road network round the site, in particular George Richards Way to the south and Manchester Road (A56) to the east. The noise climate was also observed to include contributions from activity within the service yard to the rear of the retail park.

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021.

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. The revised National Planning Policy Framework (1) published in July 2021 sets out the Government’s current planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. The NPPF supersedes the previous NPPF published in June 2019.

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. With regards to local noise and vibration, paragraph 185 states:

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. “Planning policies and decisions should also ensure that new development is appropriate for its location taking into account the likely effects (including cumulative effects) of pollution on health, living conditions and the natural environment, as well as the potential sensitivity of the site or the wider area to impacts that could arise from the development. In doing so they should:

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. a) mitigate and reduce to a minimum potential adverse impacts resulting from noise from new development – and avoid noise giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and the quality of life;

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. b) identify and protect tranquil areas which have remained relatively undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational and amenity value for this reason; and

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. c) limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and nature conservation.”

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. Reference is made to the DEFRA Noise Policy Statement for England 2010 (NPSfE). This latter document is intended to apply to all forms of noise other than that which occurs in the workplace and includes environmental noise and neighbourhood noise in all forms.

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. The NPSfE advises that the impact of noise should be assessed on the basis of adverse and significant effect but does not provide any specific guidance on assessment methods or limit sound levels. Moreover, the document advises that it is not possible to have “a single objective noise-based measure…that is applicable to all sources of noise in all situations”. It further advises that the sound level at which an adverse effect occurs is “likely to be different for different noise sources, for different receptors and at different times”.

Text: 3.1 National planning policy framework (NPPF): 2021. In the absence of specific guidance for assessment of environmental noise within the NPPF and the NPSfE, it is considered appropriate to base assessment on current British Standards and national guidance. These are considered to be Local Authority guidance, BS 4142 (2), BS 8233 (3) and the World Health Organisations (4) (WHO) guidelines.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. Current Government advice to Local Planning Authorities in both England and Wales makes reference to BS 4142 as being the appropriate guidance for assessing commercial operations and fixed building services plant noise. This British Standard provides an objective method for rating the likelihood of complaint from industrial and commercial operations. It also describes means of determining noise levels from fixed plant installations and determining the background noise levels that prevail on a site.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. The assessment of impacts is based on the subtraction of the measured background noise level from the rating level determined. The rating level is the source noise level (either measured or predicted) corrected for tone or character (if necessary). The difference is compared to the following criteria to evaluate the impact.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. – A difference of around +10 dB or more is likely to be an indication of a significant adverse impact.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. – A difference of around +5 dB indicates is likely to be an indication of an adverse impact.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. – Where the rating level does not exceed the background noise level, this is an indication of the specific sound source having a low impact.

Text: 3.2 BS 4142: 2014 – Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound. This method is only applicable for external noise levels.

It is understood that the store opening hours are 0900 to 2000 Monday to Saturday and 1000 to 1800 on Sundays, and that the proposed building services plant will operate for a maximum of an hour before the store opens and after the store closes (0800 to 2100 Monday to Saturday and 0900 to 1900 on Sundays).

Text: Figure 4: Indicative plant layout. Figure 4: Indicative plant layout.

Text: Figure 4: Indicative plant layout. An assessment of the noise emissions from the condenser units and air handling unit has been undertaken to ensure compliance with the building noise emission limits provided in Table 4 above. The manufacturers’ acoustic data has been used for each item of plant and is provided in Appendices E and F attached. In addition, a schedule of the proposed condenser units is provided in Appendix D.

Text: Figure 4: Indicative plant layout. The resultant sound pressure level one metre from the nearest residential dwellings along Princess Street (approximately 35m from the nearest part of the proposed plant zone) has been calculated using the principles of ISO 9613-2 (5) and compared to the defined building services noise emission limits. As the proposed plant will only be operational during the daytime, the assessment considers noise levels at a ground floor receptor.

Text: Figure 4: Indicative plant layout. The assessment also takes into consideration the screening provided by the boundary fence (approximately 1.8m high) surrounding the residential dwellings on Princess Street. The level of screening provided by the fence depends on the following parameters:

In order to determine the level of screening provided by the neighbouring store building, predictions have been undertaken using in-house software on the basis of the principles of ISO 9613-2. Figure 5 below provides an example of the output from the software identifying the predicted screening for condenser units 01, 02, 04 and 05 to a receiver at ground floor level of the residential dwellings on Princess Street.

Text: Figure 4: Indicative plant layout. The most appropriate way of determining noise emissions from multiple items of building services plant is through the use of the individual source sound power levels. Whilst this data is not readily available, an area correction (based on the surface area at one metre from the unit) can be applied to the sound pressure levels to estimate the source sound power levels. The following table summarises the manufacturers stated sound pressure level at one metre and the predicted sound power level of each condenser unit.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. Hoare Lea has conducted an environmental noise survey at the proposed Homesense Store at Unit 4, Altrincham Retail Park in Altrincham.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. Background noise levels typical of the daytime have been measured and used to define building services plant noise emission limits at the nearest noise sensitive receptor. The nearest noise sensitive receptors have been identified as existing residential dwellings along Princess Street and Peveril Road to the north of the proposed store.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. It is understood that the store opening hours are 0900 to 2000 Monday to Saturday and 1000 to 1800 on Sundays, and that the proposed building services plant will operate for a maximum of an hour before the store opens and after the store closes (0800 to 2100 Monday to Saturday and 0900 to 1900 on Sunday).

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. During the time in which the proposed plant will be operational, the combined building services plant noise emission contribution limit advised is 31 dB(A), one metre from the nearest noise sensitive receptor.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. An assessment of noise associated with the proposed items of building services plant has been undertaken. The predicted noise level exceeds the defined noise emission limit by up to 16 dB(A). As such, noise control measures of the air handling unit and condenser units is required.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. In order to provide sufficient attenuation of the proposed plant, a solid acoustic screen at least 0.5m higher than the height of condenser units 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 and 06 once on their anti-vibration mounts (approximately 2m high) is required. The solid screen is required to prevent a direct line of sight between the condenser units and the residential receptors on Princess Street and Peveril Road.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. In addition, attenuation of the supply fan of the air handling unit is required in order to ensure that they do not contribute to the combined noise emission levels. IN order to provide sufficient attenuation of the supply fan, a silencer of length 600mm and free area 50% is required. In order to provide sufficient attenuation of the exhaust fan of the air handling unit, a silencer of length 600mm and free area 33% is required.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. Incorporation of the above mitigation measures is sufficient to provide noise emissions in compliance with the defined noise emission limit and the requirements of Planning Condition 4.

Text: 8. Summary & conclusions. The guidance provided within this report is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Trafford Council and Planning Condition 4, in our opinion.

Text: The Sound Pressure Level The human ear has an approximately logarithmic response to sound pressure over a very large dynamic range. The lowest audible sound pressure approximately 2 x 10-5 Pa (2 ten billionths of an atmosphere) and the highest is approximately 100 Pa.

Text: The Sound Pressure Level It is therefore convenient to express the sound pressure as a logarithmic decibel scale related to this lowest human audible sound, where:

Text: The Sound Pressure Level Lp = 10 log( p2 pref 2) = 10 log( p pref)2 = 20 log( p pref)

Text: The Sound Pressure Level Where:

Text: The Sound Pressure Level Lp = sound pressure level (dB)

Text: The Sound Pressure Level p = sound pressure (Pa)

Text: The Sound Pressure Level pref = 2 x 10-5 – reference sound pressure (Pa)

Text: The Sound Pressure Level In accordance with the logarithmic scale, doubling the sound pressure level gives an increase of 6 dB.

Text: Decibel (dB) Decibel (dB)

Text: Decibel (dB) The decibel is the unit used to quantify sound pressure levels as well as sound intensity and power levels.

Text: Decibel (dB) In accordance with the logarithmic scale, an increase of 10 dB in sound pressure level is equivalent to an increase by a factor of 10 in the sound pressure level (measured in Pa). Subjectively, this increase would correspond to a doubling of the perceived loudness of the sound.

Text: Frequency Frequency

Text: Frequency The rate at which the pressure fluctuations occur determines the pitch or frequency of the sound. The frequency is expressed in Hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.

Text: Octave and Third Octave Bands Octave and Third Octave Bands

Text: Octave and Third Octave Bands An octave is the interval between two points where the frequency at the second point is twice the frequency of the first.

Text: Octave and Third Octave Bands There are many methods of describing the frequency content of a noise. The most common methods split the frequency range into defined bands, in which the mid-frequency is used as the band descriptor and in the case of octave bands is double that of the band lower. For example, two adjacent octave bands are 250 Hz and 500 Hz.

Text: Octave and Third Octave Bands Third octave bands provided a fine resolution by dividing each octave band into three bands. For examples, third octave bands would be 160 Hz, 250 Hz and 315 Hz for the same 250 Hz octave band.

Text: Octave and Third Octave Bands The human ear is sensitive to sound over a range of frequencies between approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz and is generally more sensitive to medium and high frequency than to low frequencies within the range. This is the basis of the A-weighting.

Text: A-Weighting A-Weighting

Text: A-Weighting The A-weighting is a correction term applied to the frequency range in order to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to noise. It is generally used to obtain an overall noise level from octave or third octave band frequencies.

Text: A-Weighting An A weighted value would be written as dB(A) or including A within the parameter term.

Text: Noise Units Noise Units

Text: Noise Units In order to assess environmental noise, measurements are carried out by sampling over specific periods of time, such as five minutes, the statistically determined results being used to quantify various aspects of the noise.

Text: Noise Units ACOUSTICS NOISE IMPACT ASSESSMENT – REV. 01

Text: Noise Units The figure below shows an example of sound level varying with time. Because of this time variation the same period of noise can be described by several different levels. The most common of these are described below.

Text: Leq,T Leq,T

Text: Leq,T The Leq,T is a parameter defined as the equivalent continuous sound pressure level over a defined time period ‘T’. It is the sound pressure level equivalent to the acoustic energy of the fluctuating sound signal.

Text: Leq,T The Leq,T can be thought of as an ‘average’ sound pressure level over a given time period (although it is not an arithmetic average). Typically, the Leq,T will be an A-weighted noise level in dB(A) and is commonly used to describe all types of environmental noise sources.

Text: Leq,T Loar

Text: L01,T L01,T

Text: L01,T The L01,T is a parameter defined as the sound pressure level exceeded for 1% of the measurement period ‘T’. It is a statistical parameter and cannot be directly combined to other acoustic parameter.

Text: L10,T L10,T

Text: L10,T The L10,T is a parameter defined as the sound pressure level exceeded for 10% of the measurement period ‘T’.

Text: L10,T It is a statistical parameter and cannot be directly combined to other acoustic parameter and is generally used to describe road traffic noise.

Text: L10,T Loot

Text: L90,T L90,T

Text: L90,T The L90,T is a parameter defined as the sound pressure level exceeded for 90% of the measurement period ‘T’.

Text: L90,T It is a statistical parameter and cannot be directly combined to other acoustic parameter and is generally used to describe the prevailing background noise level.

Text: L90,T Linax,T

Text: Lmax,T Lmax,T

Text: Lmax,T The Lmax,T is a parameter defined as the maximum noise level measured during the specified period ‘T’.
