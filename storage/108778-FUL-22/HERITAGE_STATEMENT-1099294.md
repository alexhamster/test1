Text: 1. Introduction 1. Introduction

Text: 1. Introduction 1.1 This Heritage Statement has been prepared by Turley (Heritage and Townscape) on behalf of Veriti and Co Ltd in connection with redevelopment (‘the Proposed Development’ of 70-72 George Street, Altrincham (‘the Site’).

Text: 1. Introduction The full description of the Proposed Development is as follows:

Text: 1. Introduction “Demolition of 70 and 72 George Street and replacement with part 3, part 4 storey (plus basement) commercial building with central courtyard, external seating to Central Way, hard landscaping to the ginnel and all associated works”.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.3 The Site is within the George Street Conservation Area. Therefore, in determining the submitted full planning application, Trafford Council has a statutory duty under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the designated area1.

Text: 1. Introduction The Site adjoins the southern boundary of the Old Market Place Conservation Area. The effect of future development on the character and appearance (significance) of the Old Market Place Conservation Area is therefore also a consideration, as a result of development within its setting.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.4

Text: 1. Introduction 1.5 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) provides the Government’s national planning policy on the conservation of the historic environment. In respect of information requirements for applications, it sets out that:

Text: 1. Introduction “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.” 2

Text: 1. Introduction 1.6

Text: 1. Introduction To comply with these requirements, Section 2 of this Statement identifies heritage assets with potential to be affected by the Proposed Development. An overview of the history and development of the Site and surrounding area is provided at Section 3 and the significance and setting of the identified heritage assets is described at Section 4, including consideration of the contribution made by the Site. An assessment of the impact of the Proposed Development, with reference to relevant legislation, national and local planning policy considerations is set out in Section 5.

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets 2. The Heritage Assets

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021 defines a heritage asset as:

Text: 2. The Heritage Assets “A building, monument, site, place, area, or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions because of its heritage interest”3

Text: Designated Heritage Assets Designated Heritage Assets

Text: Designated Heritage Assets 2.2 Designated heritage assets are those which possess a level of heritage interest that justifies designation under the relevant legislation and are then subject to particular procedures in planning decisions that involve them.

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas 2.3 The Site is within the George Street Conservation Area, originally designated in March 1987. Trafford Council adopted a Conservation Area Character Appraisal for the designated area in October 2014 and a Management Plan was subsequently adopted in March 2016. The conservation area is recorded on the Historic England Heritage at Risk, North West Register (2021). It is classed as being in poor condition, with low vulnerability and with a ‘deteriorating’ trend.

Text: Conservation Areas 2.4

Text: Conservation Areas The Old Market Place Conservation Area is located to the north west of the Site. Trafford Council also adopted a Character Appraisal and Management Plan for this conservation area in 2014 and 2016.

Text: Listed Buildings Listed Buildings

Text: Listed Buildings 2.5 The closest listed building to the Site is the grade II listed Market House. The substantial market hall of 1879 is classically influenced and occupies a prominent position at the corner of Market Street and Shaw’s Road. With the exception of views along Market Street and Greenwood Street, the building is primarily experienced within close proximity on Market Street and Shaw’s Road, where the distinction, architectural and historic interest of the Victorian market hall can be experienced and appreciated in contrast to neighbouring buildings.

Text: Listed Buildings 2.6 The Site is located to the south east of the listed building, separated from it by intervening buildings lining Greenwood Street and Central Way. Due to this degree of separation and the screening effect of existing buildings, it is not considered likely that the Proposed Development would be visible from the Market House or have any impact on significance of the asset. It has therefore been excluded from assessment.

Text: Listed Buildings The heritage assets assessed in this Statement are those identified as having potential to be affected by the Proposed Development. This is based on a series of judgements including the nature of their significance and relative contribution of setting, their proximity to and relationship with the Site, potential visibility of the Proposed Development and any known functional or historic associations.

Text: Listed Buildings 2.8 It is possible that the proposed building will be visible from other heritage assets not individually assessed within the Statement. In accordance with the NPPF and Historic England guidance the judgements made are based on the effect of the Proposed Development on the significance of the identified assets, rather than whether the development will be visible from them, although this is also a consideration.

Text: Site Location and Context Site Location and Context

Text: Site Location and Context 3.1 The Site comprises nos. 70 & 72 George Street, Altrincham and is a rectangular area of land currently occupied by modern flat roof two storey brick buildings with retail frontages to George Street, a complex of single storey extensions to the rear and a taller building with a pitched roof facing Central Way. It is bounded to the south east by George Street and to the north west by Central Way. The north eastern boundary of the Site is formed by a ginnel connecting George Street and Central Way. To the immediate south west of the Site is the adjacent property of 74 George Street and to the north east, beyond the ginnel, is The Bricklayers public house.

Text: Site Location and Context The Site lies on the north western side of George Street, a pedestrianised shopping street in Altrincham town centre. George Street runs from its junction with Regent Road in a north easterly direction as far as the modern shopping centre of the Stamford Building. Building heights along the street vary and comprise a combination of two to three storey 18th and 19th century buildings and modern late 20th and early 21st century commercial buildings of varying heights.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.3

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century In 1290 a Royal Charter by King Edward I allowed for a weekly market in Altrincham and a three day annual fair on the Feast of the Assumption. At the same time a second charter was created providing a plan for the borough including details of its administration and the way of life of its population. This led to the expansion of the medieval town to the south (corresponding with the modern areas of George Street, Market Street, Kingsway and Shaws Road) and the settlement was arranged in a series of narrow rectangular plots, perpendicular to these routes.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century A significant development for Altrincham in the 18th century was the construction of the Bridgewater Canal in 1765, which improved transport links to Manchester and resulted in greater prosperity. The road to Chester was turnpiked in 1752, with the section as far as Manchester completed by 1765. In addition, a mail coach and stage coach service between Manchester, Knutsford and Chester was introduced. These developments resulted in substantial population growth and a notable phase of re- building and development in Altrincham and the surrounding area. Many medieval properties were replaced by brick buildings, or timber framed buildings were upgraded in the new Georgian style. The 1835 Tithe Map5 indicates that by this time George Street was lined by residential properties fronting the street, with gardens to the rear.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.4

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.5 A branch line of the railway from Manchester to Altrincham was also constructed during this period to the south east of the Site, as shown on the 1882 Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.2). Several new public buildings were constructed to the south and east of the Old Market Place, including Altrincham General Hospital and a Library and Technical School on George Street.

Text: Development of Altrincham prior to the end of the 19th century 3.6 Stamford New Road was created in 1880 and a new railway station, further to the north, opened in 1881. The old station became a carriage shed. The creation of the new road affected land to the east of George Street. New Stamford Road became the focus of the town’s commercial development and George Street was subject to increasing commercial pressure; redevelopment effectively changing the street’s character from residential to commercial.

Text: Development of the Site prior to the end of the 19th century The 1835 Tithe Map6 is the first plan to show the Site in detail. The map indicates that by 1835 George Street was lined by residential properties with gardens to the rear. The properties now known as The Bricklayers Arms and no. 70 George Street are shown set back from the established building line. The map appears to show that the plot of no. 72 George Street was occupied by a building aligned north west to south east, and in combination with the properties to the north, formed a small enclosed square on the northern side of George Street. This arrangement of buildings is also shown on the 1852 Altrincham Board of Health plan7.

Text: Development of the Site prior to the end of the 19th century The 1876 Town Plan (Figure 3.3) shows the south western part of the Site occupied by two small buildings fronting onto George Street, with a series of small buildings to the rear. Adjacent buildings to the south all fronted onto George Street, following the same consistent building line. The north eastern part of the Site (no. 70) and the adjacent building (now known as the Bricklayers Arms) remained set back from the street elevation, forming a small open square. When viewed within the wider context (Figure 3.4) it is clear that at this time development was focussed along George Street. A Volunteer Drill Hall and a Unitarian Chapel were situated to the west of the Site, but the majority of land here remained undeveloped and in use as a drill ground. Some of the side streets such as George’s Square and Shaw’s Lane (to the north of the Site) had been developed with terraced properties by this time.

A more dense urban grain had been established with increasing infill development including terraced housing to the rear of properties along the north western side of George Street. This contrasted with the larger villas, set within gardens, developed away from the town centre further west.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day The trend of redevelopment, alteration and extension of properties within Altrincham town centre continued from the late 19th century into the 20th century. Properties in George Street, previously dwellings, were increasingly converted to commercial use.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day 3.11 To the west of the site, during the early 20th century a number of new buildings were constructed around the market hall, including the Town Hall (1901) and a covered market constructed to the south of the market hall (1908-1937) (Figure 3.7). These civic and commercial buildings were of greater scale than the generally small scale and finer grain of earlier development and dwellings of the town centre. Public facilities on George Street were also improved, for example through the extension of the library and adjacent art gallery in 1928 and 1934, and the construction of the Stamford Public Hall in 1940; at the northern end of George Street.

Text: Development of Altrincham from 1900 to the present day 3.12 Post war, a series of slum clearances were undertaken along with larger scale redevelopment of the town centre. The Grafton Centre was constructed at the southern end of George Street, combining retail and commercial uses and incorporating a high rise block. Further redevelopment followed the establishment of a policy for the redevelopment of the town centre, and significant redevelopment occurred including the creation of a pedestrianised shopping area, and the creation of a raised carpark and department store at the northern end of George Street. These late 20th century buildings in the vicinity of the Site were of considerably greater scale, massing and height than their predecessors.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.13 The Ordnance Survey map as surveyed in 1908 (Figure 3.6) shows that the Site was redeveloped at the turn of the century, erasing former burgage plots. Historic photographs held by Trafford Council archives show No. 70 and 72 George Street in advance of this redevelopment. The small square, enclosed on its southern side by No. 72 George Street, had by this time become known as ‘Old Beggars Square’. An additional photograph shows no. 72 George Street when demolition works were in progress; the large number of advertisements visible on the building may suggest it had been vacant for a period of time prior to its removal.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.14 The 1908 Ordnance Survey map shows that the previous terrace of properties at the rear of the Site had been cleared and replaced with a building named as ‘S.A. Hall’ (Salvation Army Hall), and an apparent new building added to George Street, with a rear yard and outbuilding. The building at the westernmost (rear) part of the Site appears to be unchanged from that shown on earlier editions of the map. A ginnel entrance ran from George Street to the rear of the Site at its south eastern corner. No 70 George Street remained unchanged, as did the remainder of other properties fronting onto George Street. Further to the east, the map shows that additional commercial properties had been constructed fronting onto the newly created Stamford New Road, which is shown as the route of a new Tramway.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.15 Redevelopment of the area continued during the 20th century. The 1936/7 Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.7) shows that the south eastern part of the Site was cleared by this date, although the S.A. Hall building and the building at the rear (north west of the Site) remained. Further to the south on George Street the increasing commercial pressure for development is evident. Small residential properties had been replaced with larger commercial buildings with wider frontages to George Street, altering the medieval burgage plot pattern of narrow frontages.

Text: Development of the Site from 1900 to the present day 3.16 The 1966-79 edition of the Ordnance Survey map (Figure 3.8) shows that the S.A. Hall and the building at the very rear (west) of the Site had been cleared by this time. New development on the Site comprised two separate narrow buildings, the northern of which (no. 70) is rectangular in plan, and the southern (no.72) is of L-shaped plan, extending behind no.70 at its western end. A further L-shaped building occupied the western part of the Site, located against the southern and western boundaries. The redevelopment of the Site led to the formation of a new ginnel running between the Site and the adjacent property of the Bricklayers Arms Public House, and connecting George Street with the yard areas to the rear of these properties. Within the wider area, the map shows the increasing trend of plot amalgamation to create larger scale commercial buildings fronting onto George Street, for example at nos. 74-80 and 88-98 George Street.

Text: Figure 3.8: Ordnance Survey (1966-1979) 1:1,250 Site location marked in red The 1978-1982 map (Figure 3.9) shows the Site to be unchanged. However, change within the wider area, is immediately evident. To the rear (west) of the Site a new road named Central Way had been created running parallel to the earlier roads of George Street and Greenwood Street. This has necessitated the removal of several former smaller buildings. The property to the immediate south of the Site had once more been redeveloped, causing further amalgamation of plots, the new property extending from 74-84 George Street. To the south, a further change in the street pattern was caused by the construction of Grafton Mall. An offshoot of Central Way, aligned approximately north east to south west forms a ramp and bridge vehicle access from Central Way to the first floor of The Grafton Mall, passing over George Street.

Text: 4. Significance of Heritage Assets The NPPF defines the significance of a heritage asset as:

Text: 4. Significance of Heritage Assets “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting”8.

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas 4.2 Conservation areas are “areas of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance.”9

Text: Conservation Areas 4.3

Text: Conservation Areas Historic England has published Good Practice Advice (GPA) on ‘Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment’ to assist in assessing the significance of heritage assets. This guidance has informed the following assessments of significance.

Text: Setting Setting

Text: Setting The NPPF defines the setting of a heritage asset as:

Text: Setting “The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral10.”

Text: Setting 4.5 Historic England has published guidance11 in respect of the setting of heritage assets, providing detail on understanding setting and the associated assessment of the impact of any changes. The guidance confirms at paragraph 9 that setting is not itself a heritage asset or a heritage designation, rather its importance lies in what it contributes to the significance of the relevant heritage asset itself.

Text: Setting 4.6 Further guidance on the definition of setting and how it should be taken into account is set out in national Planning Practice Guidance. In assessing the contribution of setting to the significance of the following identified assets the role of the Site has also been considered.

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.8 The George Street Conservation Area covers only the southern part of George Street, to the south of Shaw’s Road and Cross Street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.9 A summary significance statement for the George Street Conservation Area is included in the Conservation Area Management Plan, it states the following:

Text: George Street Conservation Area “The historic value of the George Street Conservation Area is the driving force behind its significance and stems from its long history of urban settlement from the medieval period. George Street formed the spine of the Lower Town, a working class area with a mixture of residential buildings and artisanal workshops. Some of the existing plots still retain their historic medieval burgage plot boundaries. It is notable that the present defining characteristic of the Conservation Area as a retail and commercial hub has continually evolved since the early Victorian period, resulting in the variety of building styles and dates. The survival of some historic ginnels is also significant. Aesthetically, there is substantial scope for improvements as there are a number of visually intrusive and detracting features which have a cumulative negative effect on the significance of the Conservation Area.” (Page 8)

Text: George Street Conservation Area 4.10 Key elements of the character and appearance of George Street Conservation Area are as follows:

Text: George Street Conservation Area •

Text: George Street Conservation Area Some existing property boundaries reflect the medieval burgage plots fronting onto George Street. In cases where plots have been amalgamated, ground floor building frontages and fenestration in some cases reflect the historic burgage pattern.

Text: George Street Conservation Area Primary frontages of buildings face onto the primary street of George Street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Buildings within the conservation area are of varying date and architectural style, dating from the Georgian, Victorian and 20th century periods. They reflect the gradual evolution of George Street from a residential street to a commercial high street.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Building heights vary, but historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of two or three storeys in height.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of brick with pitched blue slate roofs

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Historic buildings within the conservation area are generally of simple classical style with classical proportions, commonly symmetrical facades and a regular fenestration patterns, and including other classical details such as stone string courses, dentillated eaves, prominent cornices, plain stone cills and multi pane timber sash windows.

Text: George Street Conservation Area • Polychromatic brickwork (yellow brick with red brick detailing) is a notable characteristic at first and second storey level, and many buildings on the eastern side of the street include gothic revival detailing (including gable ends fronting onto the street ornamented with bargeboards, pointed arch windows and decorative chimney stacks).

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.12 As described above, Nos. 70 & 72 George Street comprise modern two storey buildings of concrete and brick construction with flat roofs and separate modern retail frontages at ground floor. Both units are a combination of brick panels, large modern window openings (with flanking narrower units at the eaves) and concrete at first floor. No 70 has a small section of tiling between the shopfront and upper windows. Both buildings are assumed to be contemporary (built in c. 1970) and are likely to have been designed and built as a pair of symmetrical commercial buildings. They are no longer consistent. The upper windows of No.72 have been replaced with UPVC units and the ground floor shopfronts are of differing design. A mock Victorian lamp is attached to the frontage of No. 72. To the rear are a series of flat roof modern extensions and facing Central Way is a taller building of mid to late 20th century construction in brick and concrete, on raised concrete pillars and with a shallow pitched roof.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.13 The extant buildings on the Site, fronting George Street, broadly correspond with the general characteristics of George Street, due to their height, brick construction and alignment. They do not however possess the quality of architecture, detailing or materials found on the traditional buildings of George Street, or those that contribute to the character and appearance and townscape of the designated area. Modern flat

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 15

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area roofs are not uncommon on George Street (the western side in particular) but they deviate from the pitched roofs of traditional buildings lining the route and do not contribute to a varied roofscape. The existing exposed side elevation of No. 70 is plain, with the exception of vertical brick piers and narrow windows at eaves height.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.14 The existing expression of the two buildings with separate shopfronts corresponds (broadly) with the grain of the historic burgage plots. However, consideration of historic mapping has shown that originally the property at No. 70 George Street was set back from the street line, forming the southern side of an open square (bounded by the Bricklayer’s Arms Public House to the west). Similarly, the ginnel to the immediate north of the Site (between 70 George Street and the Bricklayers Arms Public House) appears to form part of the historic street pattern, but is a recent addition to the area, formed when the current buildings were built in c.1970.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.15 Overall, as viewed from George Street, it is considered that the extant buildings within the Site make a neutral contribution to the Conservation Area.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of George Street Conservation Area 4.16 The Conservation Area Appraisal however notes that the rear of no. 72 George Street makes a negative contribution to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, as viewed from Central Way. Central Way was created in the late 1970s, and is therefore also a modern addition to the conservation area. It would originally have formed backlands to the properties fronting onto George Street. Historic mapping shows that buildings in this area comprised rear additions and ancillary buildings and structures associated with those fronting onto George Street, rather than forming a defined and intentional built edge.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.17 The following section considers the special character of the Old Market Place Conservation Area.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.18 The special interest of the Conservation Area lies in the history and development of the area and its market function which is still evident in its streetscene and historic market town character. The Old Market Place Conservation Area Character Appraisal highlights the modest scale and massing of buildings which contribute to that character and create strong building lines along main routes. The appraisal acknowledges that civic buildings in the conservation area tend to be taller.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area The majority of buildings are C19 or earlier and retain a variety of historic architectural detailing which gives the area a high level of aesthetic value and a sense of historic character. The architectural styles and historic plan forms of buildings document the historic development of Altrincham and continuation of habitation from the medieval period to the present day. Buildings range from substantial civic buildings and historic commercial properties interspersed with smaller areas of good quality residential properties with landscaping.

Text: Old Market Place Conservation Area The consistent use of traditional building materials including brick, slate, sandstone and painted joinery and local detailing repeated throughout the conservation area gives the area a sense of visual harmony.

The reason given for the extension in the Conservation Area Appraisal relates solely to the inclusion of 10 to 22 Shaw’s Road as ‘low key Victorian shops’ that reflect the character of nearby Market Street.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.21 There is no explanation as to why the southern boundary was extended to include Central Way and the only references to the street in the Conservation Area Appraisal relate to the creation of the public square including the Lower Market canopy, the areas of car parking to the north and south of the route and examples of inappropriate boundary treatments.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.22 As described in relation to the George Street Conservation Area, Central Way is a modern route created in the 1970s. The southern part of the route in particular is bounded by areas of car parking, the private rear curtilages of buildings lining Greenwood Street and the rear elevations of buildings lining George Street. These are

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area typically plain, functional or ancillary rear elevations. There is a mix of building forms including pitched roof extensions, standalone buildings and the blank rear elevations and service areas of flat roofed commercial buildings lining George Street, including the Site. The southern part of the street has no coherence. It is an area of disparate and fragmented townscape that lacks the definition and enclosure that is characteristic of many of the other streets within the commercial core of Altrincham.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.23

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area It is recognised in the Conservation Area Appraisal that the northern part of Central Way has been enhanced by the introduction of the Lower Market Hall. More recent improvement has been made by the Everyman Cinema and the direct engagement it has with the street.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.24 It is acknowledged in the George Street Conservation Area Appraisal that the rear of no. 72 George Street makes a negative contribution to the character and appearance of the designated area as viewed from Central Way. The same principle applies to the Old Market Place Conservation Area. The raised form of the existing building breaks the building line and it presents in inactive and unattractive elevation to Central Way, whilst recognising that the unit was temporarily enhanced through the addition of food and drink use in 2020.

Text: Contribution of the Site to the Character and Appearance of Old Market Place Conservation Area 4.25 In describing the enhancements already made to Central Way, the Old Market Place Conservation Area Appraisal states the following:

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.1 Under s72(1) of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council, in determining the submitted planning application has statutory duties to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the George Street Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.2 Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.3 Paragraph 199 requires when considering the impact of development on the significance of a designated heritage asset that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation. ‘Conservation’ is defined by the NPPF as ‘the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance.’

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.4 Paragraphs 200 and 201 differentiate between ‘substantial’ and ‘less than substantial harm’ and provide a framework for the consideration of harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, where it arises, bearing in mind the considerable importance and weight that must be given to the statutory duties of the 1990 Act.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.5

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities look for opportunities for new development within the setting of heritage assets to better reveal their significance. It states that proposals that preserve those elements of setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of the asset should be treated favourably.

Text: The Proposed Development 5.9 A three storey building is proposed fronting George Street, containing two retail units at ground floor, with office accommodation above. The proposed building is principally of red multi brickwork with darker brickwork at ground floor. The approach to the façade is continued on the side, north facing elevation, facing The Bricklayers. The two upper floors are of diminishing proportions, delineated by Corten steel string courses and arranged as four window bays. Window units are metal framed and set in stone

Text: The Proposed Development 5.10 A mural, the details of which are to be agreed, is proposed on the facing wall of a central courtyard and the ginnel between George Street and Central Way is to be re- connected.

Text: The Proposed Development 5.11 A four storey building is proposed in the western part of the Site, addressing Central Way. Commercial (food and drink) use is proposed at ground floor with office accommodation above. The ground floor has large glazed openings in stone surrounds and the upper floors are arranged in four window bays, echoing the proportions and appearance of the George Street façade. The fourth floor is recessed, with a shallow pitched roof, and clad in Corten steel.

Text: Assessment of Impact Assessment of Impact

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.12 By incorporating a mix of retail use and associated shopfronts at ground floor with office accommodation above, the building fronting George Street can, subject to detailing of the proposed shopfronts, reflect and continue the traditional commercial characteristics of the conservation area.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.13 The proposed building, extending to three storeys, is taller than the existing shops. There are however a number of existing buildings of three storeys on George Street and within this part of the conservation area and variety in building heights is characteristic of the designated area due to the broad range of buildings of different ages and styles. Drawings prepared by View Associates show that the proposed building would be of comparable height to 85 to 87 George Street opposite. It is not considered that the increase in building heights from the existing to three storeys would be harmful based on the variety of building heights that already exist on George Street and the contextual approach taken to the design of the building.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.14 To the south of The Bricklayers the existing and adjoining building creates an accumulation of flat roofs in this part of the conservation area. The proposed building will introduce a series of pitched and gabled roof forms that will contribute to a more varied roofscape at the north of the conservation area, in combination with the traditional buildings further north and opposite.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.15 The proposed red brick construction of the proposed building is characteristic of the conservation area and is the prevailing building material on George Street. The diminishing proportions of the upper floors and ratio of solid to void is consistent with nearby historic and traditional buildings, in contrast to the enlarged glazing of the shopfronts. Symmetrical facades with regular fenestration are characteristic of the conservation area and the proposed building follows this approach. Classical details such as string courses and stone cills are also common features. These are applied as contemporary accents to the proposed building.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.16 The existing mid to late 20th century building to the rear of 72 George Street and the area beneath it is described by Trafford Council in the George Street Conservation Area Character Appraisal as ‘particularly intrusive’. It is identified as having potential to be refurbished or redeveloped, subject to new development reflecting the architectural

Text: Assessment of Impact and historic interest of the area, and not having a detrimental effect on the character or appearance of the conservation area. Redevelopment of the Site therefore presents an opportunity for permanent enhancement, bearing in mind the enhancements made to the building during 2020.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.17 By positioning the increased height at the rear of the Site, the broad datum of George Street is maintained and the additional height is experienced from Central Way, where sensitivity is decreased. The height of the proposed building has been markedly reduced during the pre-application process and pitched roof forms have been introduced in response to feedback from Trafford Council. The upper floor has been designed to be both visually recessive, but with a pitched roof form to contribute to the varied roofscape of the conservation area and to echo the profile of the Market House.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.18 The level of enclosure and continuous frontage created by existing buildings along George Street and Greenwood Street, indicates that visual impact is likely to be focussed on south westerly views from the corner of George Street and Cross Street and from Central Way. In this respect it is anticipated that the visual impact of additional height will be localised. The proposed building will not diminish the landmark quality of any key buildings or adversely affect key views from or of the Old Market Place Conservation Area.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.19 It was identified during design development that due to the set back of the Bricklayers Arms, a building of increased height would be clearly visible in combination with the public house (recognised as making a positive contribution to the George Street Conservation Area). Visualisations submitted with the planning application illustrate the way in which the combination of materials, different forms of the proposed buildings and the set back created by the open central courtyard can create a varied backdrop to The Bricklayers in south west views from George Street, whilst ensuring the distinctiveness and prominence of the public house prevails.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.20 In response to guidance within the Conservation Area Management Plan the proposed building design is contemporary but with reference to building materials of both conservation areas and the need for quality. The proposed building fronting Central Way will respect the enclosure and continuous building line in the northern extent of Central Way and will create an active frontage, contributing to enhancement works already undertaken but without disrupting legibility of the street hierarchy due to the order and simplicity of the building façade. The proposed building has similar characteristics to the proposed building fronting George Street but has been simplified to reflect the more informal nature of Central Way.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.21 Although a later addition and dates to the 1970s, the existing ginnel between George Street and Central Way between the public house and the Site reflects the historic street pattern and former connections and the opportunity to re-open this route is positive.

Text: Assessment of Impact 5.22 Due to a marked reduction in building heights during the pre-application process, it is not considered that the visual impact created by a building of the height proposed would harm either the George Street or Old Market Place Conservation Areas. The

Text: The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires that in the exercise of planning functions with respect to any buildings or land in a conservation area that special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of that area.

Text: The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 Case law has confirmed that Parliament’s intention in enacting section 66(1) was that decision makers should give “considerable importance and weight” to the desirability of preserving the special interest and setting of listed buildings, where “preserve” means to “to do no harm”. The presumption is therefore that development proposals should not give rise to harm to the special interest of a listed building. This duty must be borne in mind strongly when considering cases where harm may be considered to accrue, and then the balancing of such harm against public benefits as required by national planning policy.

Text: The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 The same principles apply for conservation areas and the application of s72(1) of the 1990 Act. Whilst the setting of conservation areas is not specifically mentioned in the primary legislation, the NPPF states that the setting of a designated heritage asset can contribute to its significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Chapter 16 outlines the Government’s guidance regarding conserving and enhancing the historic environment.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 194 outlines the information required to support planning applications affecting heritage assets, stating that applicants should provide a description of the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 197 states that with regard to determining planning applications planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of the heritage assets, and putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 199 confirms that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be. It is also confirmed that significance can be harmed or lost through alteration or destruction of the heritage asset or development within its setting. Any harm to, or loss, of significance of a designated heritage asset should require clear and convincing justification.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 202 is applicable where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset. In these circumstances, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimum viable use.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 206 states that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within the setting of heritage assets to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to or better reveal the significance of a heritage asset should be treated favourably.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 207 identifies that not all elements of a conservation area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution should be treated either as substantial harm under paragraph 201 or less than substantial harm under paragraph 202, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the conservation area as a whole.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Historic England revised its guidance relating to setting and views of heritage assets. The guidance advocates a staged approach to assessment involving identification of the affected assets and setting, an assessment of the degree to which setting and views contribute to the significance of the assets, an assessment of the effects of the proposed development, exploration of ways to maximise enhancement and avoid or minimise harm and the monitoring of outcomes.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The revised guidance clarifies that there is a distinction between views that contribute to heritage significance and views that might be valued for reasons of landscape character or visual amenity. It states that the extent and importance of setting is often expressed by reference to visual considerations. Although views of or from an asset will play an important part, the way in which we experience an asset in its setting is also influenced by other environmental factors

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The guidance makes it clear at paragraph 9 that setting is not a heritage asset, nor a heritage designation, rather its importance lies in what it contributes to the significance of the relevant heritage asset itself. The guidance sets out the need for a systematic and staged approach to assessing the impact of development proposals in the setting of a heritage asset. It confirms that such assessment should be based on an understanding of the significance of the heritage assets affected and then the contribution of setting to that significance. Guidance is provided on what potential attributes of setting may or may not make a contribution to the significance of a heritage asset, noting that in any one instance a limited selection of the attributes will be of particular relevance to an asset. These attributes can include:

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) The asset’s physical surroundings;

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) • Experience of the asset;

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) An asset’s associative relationships with other heritage assets.

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) It is identified that views which contribute more to understanding the significance of a heritage asset include the following:

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) • Those where the composition within the view was a fundamental aspect of the design or function of the heritage asset

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Those where town- or village-scape reveals views with unplanned or unintended beauty

Text: Good Practice Advice Note 3: The Setting of Heritage Assets, Historic England (2017) Those with historic or cultural associations
