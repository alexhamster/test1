Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION KP Acoustics Ltd has been commissioned by Inform Surveying Ltd, 7, Neepsend Triangle Business Centre, 1 Burton Rd, Neepsend, Sheffield S3 8BW, to undertake a noise impact assessment of the car washing bay at Enterprise, Manchester Rd, West Timperley, Timperley, Altrincham WA14 5PH.

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION A 24-hour environmental noise survey and manual noise measurements have been undertaken on site in order to prepare a noise impact assessment in accordance with BS4142:2014 ‘Method for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’.

Text: 1.0 INTRODUCTION This report presents the methodology and results from the environmental survey, followed by calculations in accordance with BS4142 to provide an indication as to the likelihood of the noise emissions from washing and cleaning cars having an adverse impact on the closest noise sensitive receiver. Mitigation measures will be outlined as appropriate.

Text: 3.1 Environmental Noise Survey The LAeq: 5min, LAmax: 5min, LA10: 5min and LA90: 5min acoustic parameters were measured throughout the duration of the survey. Measured levels are shown as a time history in Figure 25303.TH1. Measured average background noise levels are shown in Table 3.1 for daytime and night-time. It should be noted that the average background noise level has been derived from the most commonly occurring LA90,5 min levels measured during the environmental noise survey undertaken on site, as shown in 25303.Daytime.LA90 and 25303.Night-time.LA90 attached.

Text: Table 3.1 Background noise levels measured at 24 hour unattended location. It is understood that, during the survey, cars were being washed intermittently between 09.00 – 16.00hrs. Therefore, to determine a representative background noise level at the nearest NSR, the modal background noise level between the period 16.00 – 18.00hrs was used, so that measured levels were not affected by noise from the washing bay. This 2 hour period was then attenuated by 3dB to account for the distance attenuation to the NSR compared to the Enterprise site. This representative daytime background noise level at the nearest NSR is given in Table 3.2 below.

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ This Standard compares the Rating Level due to the noise source/s under assessment for a one-hour period during the daytime (07:00 – 23:00 hours) and a fifteen-minute period during the night-time (23:00 – 07:00 hours) with the existing background noise level in terms of an LA90 when the noise source is not operating.

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ It should be noted that the Rating Level is the Specific Sound Level in question (LAeq, Tr), including any relevant acoustic feature corrections, as follows:

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ • Tonality – ‘For sound ranging from not tonal to prominently tonal the Joint Nordic

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ on the context

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ • The lower the rating level is relative to the measured background sound level, the less likely it is that there will be an adverse impact or significant adverse impact. Where the rating level does not exceed the background sound level, this is an indication of the specific sound having a low impact, depending on the context

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ NOTE: Adverse impacts may include but not be limited to annoyance and sleep disturbance. Not all adverse impacts will lead to complaints and not every complaint is proof of an adverse impact.

Text: BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ The initial estimate of the impact may then be modified by taking consideration of the context in which the sound occurs.

Text: Decibel scale - dB Decibel scale - dB

Text: Decibel scale - dB In practice, when sound intensity or sound pressure is measured, a logarithmic scale is used in which the unit is the ‘decibel’, dB. This is derived from the human auditory system, where the dynamic range of human hearing is so large, in the order of 107? units, that only a logarithmic scale is the sensible solution for displaying such a range.

Text: Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A)

Text: Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) The human ear is less sensitive at frequency extremes, below 125Hz and above 16Khz. A sound level meter models the ears variable sensitivity to sound at different frequencies. This is achieved by building a filter into the Sound Level Meter with a similar frequency response to that of the ear, an A-weighted filter where the unit is dB(A).

Text: Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) Leq

Text: Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) The sound from noise sources often fluctuates widely during a given period of time. An average value can be measured, the equivalent sound pressure level Leg. The Leg is the equivalent sound level which would deliver the same sound energy as the actual fluctuating sound measured in the same time period.

Text: Lio Lio

Text: Lio This is the level exceeded for no more than 10% of the time. This parameter is often used as a “not to exceed” criterion for noise.

Text: Leo Leo

Text: Leo This is the level exceeded for no more than 90% of the time. This parameter is often used as a descriptor of “background noise” for environmental impact studies.

Text: Lmax Lmax

Text: Lmax This is the maximum sound pressure level that has been measured over a period.

Text: Octave Bands Octave Bands

Text: Octave Bands In order to completely determine the composition of a sound it is necessary to determine the sound level at each frequency individually. Usually, values are stated in octave bands. The audible frequency region is divided into 11 such octave bands whose centre frequencies are defined in accordance with international standards. These centre frequencies are: 16, 31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 16000 Hertz.

Text: Addition of noise from several sources Addition of noise from several sources

Text: Addition of noise from several sources Noise from different sound sources combines to produce a sound level higher than that from any individual source. Two equally intense sound sources operating together produce a sound level which is 3B higher than a single source and 4 sources produce a 6dB higher sound level.

Text: Attenuation by distance Attenuation by distance

Text: Attenuation by distance Sound which propagates from a point source in free air attenuates by 6dB for each doubling of distance from the noise source. Sound energy from line sources (e.g. stream of cars) drops off by 3dB for each doubling of distance.

Text: Subjective impression of noise Subjective impression of noise

Text: Subjective impression of noise Hearing perception is highly individualised. Sensitivity to noise also depends on frequency content, time of occurrence, duration of sound and psychological factors such as emotion and expectations. The following table is a guide to explain increases or decreases in sound levels for many scenarios.

Text: Subjective impression of noise Change in sound level (dB) Change in perceived loudness 1 Imperceptible 3 Just barely perceptible 6 Clearly noticeable 10 About twice as loud

Text: Transmission path(s) Transmission path(s)

Text: Transmission path(s) The transmission path is the path the sound takes from the source to the receiver. Where multiple paths exist in parallel, the reduction in each path should be calculated and summed at the receiving point. Outdoor barriers can block transmission paths, for example traffic noise. The effectiveness of barriers is dependent on factors such as its distance from the noise source and the receiver, its height and construction.

Text: Ground-borne vibration Ground-borne vibration

Text: Ground-borne vibration In addition to airborne noise levels caused by transportation, construction, and industrial sources there is also the generation of ground-borne vibration to consider. This can lead to structure-borne noise, perceptible vibration, or in rare cases, building damage.

Text: Sound insulation - Absorption within porous materials Sound insulation - Absorption within porous materials

Text: Sound insulation - Absorption within porous materials Upon encountering a porous material, sound energy is absorbed. Porous materials which are intended to absorb sound are known as absorbents, and usually absorb 50 to 90% of the energy and are frequency dependent. Some are designed to absorb low frequencies, some for high frequencies and more exotic designs being able to absorb very wide ranges of frequencies. The energy is converted into both mechanical movement and heat within the material; both the stiffness and mass of panels affect the sound insulation performance.
