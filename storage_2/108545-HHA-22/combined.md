Text: Pre-application Advice Details of the pre-application advice received

Text: Pre-application Advice Planning Portal Reference: PP-11371075

Text: Pre-application Advice Good speaking with you earlier. As requested I have summarised below the principles agreed in the meeting:

Text: Pre-application Advice Side /rear extension

Text: Pre-application Advice Revise roof design to a pitch, (which retains the existing first floor dressing room window on the original side elevation). Some conservation style rooflights within the roof agreed subject to design.

Text: Pre-application Advice To the rear of the side extension, rearranging internal layout to allow windows on the rear elevation.

Text: Pre-application Advice Single storey rear extension on the inside of the existing outrigger

Text: Pre-application Advice Roof design to be amended. Pitched with potential alterations to existing first floor bathroom window, in the side of the existing outrigger.

Text: Pre-application Advice First floor rear extension

Text: Pre-application Advice The first floor element seems to unbalance rear elevation and roof design is difficult. Ideally we would request the first floor extension is removed if possible. Would be happy to discuss alternative roof design if anything comes to mind.

Text: Pre-application Advice Materials

Text: Pre-application Advice Most proposed so far are acceptable (subject to details being agreed) i.e.:

Text: Pre-application Advice · Cheshire brick (brick window headers to match existing also)

Text: Pre-application Advice · Slate roof tiles

Text: Pre-application Advice · Painted timber window and door frames – flush casement with mullion bars to match existing.

Text: Pre-application Advice Aluminium RWG required (colour black) though, rather than UPVC.

Text: Proposals Proposals

Text: Proposals The property is detached and sits between / adjacent to other detached and semi-detached Victorian style houses,

Text: Proposals located within the Bowdon Conservation Area. See diagram 1 Conservation area map below.

Text: Proposals Diagram 1. Bowdon Conservation Area

Text: Proposals Bowdon Conservation area is made up of architectural quality and built form in areas identified by Character zones our property falls under Character Zone C: The early Victorian expansion.

Text: Proposals Although there is a range of plot and house sizes and materials, the predominant impression is of large houses, built in various colours; buff, red, brown bricks and white renders generally set within gardens with mature trees and shrubs.

Text: Proposals The property, dating from the late 18th Century (circa. 1838 – 1877), shares many of the characteristics of the area.

Text: Proposals See diagram 3 Building dates below.

Text: Proposals 3

Text: Proposals Paragraphs 189-202 “Conserving and enhancing the historic environment” of the National Planning Policy Framework have been consulted while considering the application proposals together with the Bowdon Conservation Area Appraisal and CA management Plan.

Text: Proposals The property is not listed and features, albeit minimally, in the Bowdon Conservation Area history.

Text: Proposals The property consists of the main house; a four-storey detached dwelling, with further single storey accommodation to the side providing an open plan sun lounge and breakfast area with various configurations of three adjoined roof types; flat roof with lantern, pitch roof with small dormer and a lean-two structure to the rear. The opposite side of the plot includes a double garage with storage and terrace above. Built in Cheshire brick, the use of dark and red stocks for decoration and detailing. Existing stone cills are painted. The basements form additional habitable space with existing light wells providing natural daylight.

Text: Proposals The scale and massing within this character zone is larger that of Character Zone B with plot sizes larger and the heights of the structures greater, which also encompasses a variety in terms of size and style, both in the original structures and as a result of subsequent re-development. See diagram 2 Character Zone below.

Text: Proposals Diagram 2 & 3. Bowdon Conservation Area - Character Zones & Buildings Dates

Text: Proposals The single storey accommodation formed part of the works carried out by a previous owner/architect – application no. H/46630 (decision date 20th January 1999) for the erection of single storey side extension and first floor rear extension to form additional living accommodation following the demolition of the existing conservatory. Conversion of the existing outhouse to form guest accommodation and erection of an extension to outhouse to form double garage and storage area with terrace above. Extension of existing basement to form practice studio.

Text: Proposals 4

Text: Design Design

Text: Design Design Proposals

Text: Design The proposal includes partial demolition of the existing side extension and erection of a new single side extension providing extended living accommodation. To the rear new extended single storey extension forming a larger kitchen/ breakfast area with a partial first floor extension to the family bathroom.

Text: Design The existing side extension was a later addition by the previous owners and is to be partially demolished as the origi- nal build materials have not stood the test of time. This demolition and replacement is inevitable.

Text: Design The partial rebuild of the side extension will be marginally larger in footprint by 12.6sq.m / 135sq.ft. and will be built using reclaimed Cheshire brick and flush mortar joints to match the existing dwelling and keyed in the coursing.

Text: Design Introduction of new windows in the style of main house and an opportunity to introduce further natural light into the interior. The original inglenook fireplace to be retained and the existing chimney taken down to a appropriate level to allow for a black external flue liner to be installed. The new pitched roof will be installed along the full length of exten- sion, the main living space will have a vaulted ceiling with recessed conservation roof lights surrounded by natural reclaimed /new grey slate tiles. Over the utility room a flat ceiling. On the front gable elevation the introduction of a new small window above the door in the style of an existing window to the main house.

Text: Design To the rear a new extended single storey extension forming a larger kitchen/breakfast area with a partial first floor extension to the family bathroom again in matching Cheshire brick with windows and French patio doors to match the style of the existing painted timber frames. The footprint of this element of extension would be 17sq.m / 182sq.ft. Roofing these two parts will consist of:

Text: Design Ground floor—flat sedum green roof with a fixed roof light over the kitchen area.

Text: Design First floor—mono pitched slate roof to tie-in with the existing pitch roof of the existing two storey extension to achieve the same pitch. We undertook various case studies of roof configuration and decided on this option, which was more in keeping aesthetically. We have reused the existing window taken out to form new door opening in the new extension.

Text: Design We also reviewed the opportunity to put a mono-pitch roof over the kitchen, but decided that this would have a large impact on the existing large window/door to the master en-suite and would also limit the position of the air source heat pump system (currently submitted on a previous application).

Text: Design Following an informal consultation with the planner and Heritage Officer this week, we have taken on-board all the comments where possible and adhered this to the scheme.

Text: Design Use

Text: Design The use of the property as a domestic residence will remain unaltered.

Text: Design Amount

Text: Design N/A

Text: Design 5

Text: Layout Layout

Text: Layout The proposed new extensions will be marginally larger in foot-print by 29.6sq.m / 318sq.ft to the original and main- taining a similar height through the new pitched roof of the original roof.

Text: Layout The site is surrounded on three sides by the neighbouring properties, the proposed works with have no visible impact on the neighbours, but will improve on the look and function of the poorly designed side extension that has been en- dured over the past 20 years.

Text: Landscaping Appearance

Text: Landscaping The materials proposed for the side and rear extensions is stated above.

Text: Landscaping Access

Text: Landscaping The current access will be maintained as existing,

Text: Landscaping The parking will also remain unaltered on the existing driveway and in the double garage.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion The proposed new extensions will have a positive impact on the positive contributor within the conservation area of Bowdon and removes and realigns this poor quality addition by a previous owner.

Text: Conclusion The proposed materials will match existing where appropriate and the new side extension has been carefully de- signed to respect the original building and the local context. The extensions will preserve the character and appear- ance of The Bowdon Conservation Area, therefore, the proposal passes the statutory test in Section 72 of the Plan- ning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990.

Text: Conclusion It is considered that the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF and Core Strategy Policies and planning permission should be granted.

Text: 1.5. Site context 1.5. Site context

Text: 1.5. Site context The house is located on Stamford Road, Bowdon, WA14 2JN, GR SJ 76355 86911, approximately 1.5km southwest of Altrincham Town Centre. It is surrounded by suburban houses with mature gardens and trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site includes an occupied pre-1950’s detached house with gardens to the front and rear, and areas of hard landscaping.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 50m of the house includes; houses, gardens, mature trees, and busy well-lit roads.

Text: 1.5. Site context Habitat within 500m includes, housing and busy roads, linked back gardens, areas of open green-space, mature trees.

Text: 1.5. Site context Linked back gardens, potentially provide low quality foraging opportunities for bats. However, the area in general is fragmented by busy well-lit roads, noise, trafﬁc, and other human activity. The closest high quality habitats are 1km to the south along The Bollin Valley.

Text: 1.5. Site context The site and surrounding area provide low quality foraging, commuting, and roosting opportunities for bats, with higher quality habitat to the north.

Text: 2.2. Desk study 2.2. Desk study

Text: 2.2. Desk study No desk study of the site was undertaken, prior to the preliminary roost assessment, and no other ecological surveys have been carried out in relation to the proposals.

Text: 2.2. Desk study The development has a small footprint, and impacts beyond the site boundary are unlikely. A site-speciﬁc investigation was considered more suitable.

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment 2.3. Habitat assessment

Text: 2.3. Habitat assessment The habitat on site and in the surrounding area was assessed using Ordinance Survey mapping, and aerial photography. Habitat features on site, and those in the surrounding area were assessed for their suitability for use by bats during the site visit.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection 2.4. Building inspection

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the exterior of the building was made to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate any evidence of bats such as live or dead specimens, bat droppings, urine splashes, fur-oil staining and or squeaking noises. Bat specimens and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence; the other types are not always the result of bat activity. Sometimes bats leave no visible sign of their presence on the outside of a building (even when they do wet weather can wash evidence away.)

Text: 2.4. Building inspection The search included (where present) the ground beneath potential access points, windowsills, window panes, walls, behind peeling paintwork and lifted rendering, hanging tiles, weatherboarding, eaves, sofﬁt boxes, fascia’s, lead ﬂashing, gaps under felt, under tiles / slates and in existing bats boxes. Gaps in brickwork and stonework were searched (where present). All evidence of use by bats, or features with the potential to be used by bats was recorded and photographed.

Text: 2.4. Building inspection A systematic search of the inside of the building was undertaken to identify potential or actual bat access points and roosting places, and to locate evidence of bats. Bat specimens (live or dead) and droppings are the most reliable type of evidence. Other evidence can include urine splashes, fur-oil staining, feeding remains, squeaking noises, bat ﬂy (Nycteribiid) pupal cases (Hutson 1984) or odour.

Text: 3.1. External inspection 3.1. External inspection

Text: 3.1. External inspection 3.1a – The front of the house.

Text: 3.1. External inspection No53 Stamford Road, Bowdon is a pre-1950’s detached house which is occupied. It has an equally pitched roof, covered with slate roof tiles, and ceramic ridge tiles. Roof pitches face east, and west. A ground ﬂoor extension on the east side of the house has a glass panelled roof with a section of slate roof in the centre. Lead ﬂashing is ﬁtted at the base of chimneys, roof valleys, and where tiles abut brickwork.

Text: 3.1. External inspection End tiles at the verges are sealed with cement. Wooden fascia boards are ﬁtted at the eaves and gables.

Text: 3.1. External inspection Walls are solid brick with no insulating cavity, lintels are ﬂat arched brick, sills are stone; window and door frames are timber, all glass is intact.

Text: 3.1. External inspection The building was constructed to a high standard, is well maintained, and in good condition. Ridge tiles are ﬁxed tightly, there are no damaged or missing ridge tiles. There are no damaged, slipped, or missing roof tiles. Roof tiles are tightly ﬁtted, with no gaps between tiles. Cement at the verges is intact with no viable gaps. Wooden fascia boards are ﬁtted tightly against the walls gaps are ﬁlled with sealant. Walls are in good condition, with no missing mortar or cracks.

Text: 3.1. External inspection There are no features externally which are likely be used by roosting bats, and no indications of use by bats were present during the inspection.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2. Internal inspection

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.2a – The roof void.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The house has a single roof void, which is used for storage, and accessed occasionally for essential maintenance.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection The roof has a timber rafter and purlin structure, which has been sprayed with foam insulation on the underside of tiles, and is insulated between the ceiling joists with mineral wool.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection Gaps between brickwork, timbers, and rooﬁng materials at the gable ends were inspected in detail using an endoscope. Any gaps have been ﬁlled with insulation. These areas are dusty and cobwebbed, and show no indications of use.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection There are no gaps at the wall-plate; and there are no gaps which give direct access to the roof void from the outside. Roof timbers at the apex, and gables are covered in dusty cobwebs.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection Ceilings in the ground ﬂoor extension on the east side of the house are glass panelled, or fully vaulted.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection Cellars are used for storage and accessed regularly. There are no entrance points which could give bats direct, or crawled, access from outside. There are no other enclosed spaces which are suitable to be used by roosting bats.

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection 3.3. Indications of use

Text: 3.2. Internal inspection No Indications of use by bats were present during the inspection, either internally, or externally.

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability 3.4. Level of suitability

Text: 3.4. Level of suitability The house has negligible suitability for use by roosting bats. This is as the building is well maintained, in good condition, and as no suitable roosting opportunities were noted during the building inspection.

Text: 4. Evaluation 4. Evaluation

Text: 4. Evaluation The building is set in an area which, in general, provides low quality habitat, for foraging, commuting and roosting bats, although bats are likely to be present locally.

Text: 4. Evaluation Areas of open green space, and linked back gardens locally provide limited foraging opportunities for bats, in an area which is fragmented by light and noise disturbance.

Text: 4. Evaluation Houses immediately adjacent to good quality habitat are more likely to be used by roosting bats than those further away. The house is 1km from higher quality habitat. Additionally, the house is well-sealed, and has no features which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The area in general is fragmented by well-lit roads, trafﬁc, noise, and other human activity. Fragmentation is likely to reduce the number of species present locally, and the number of individual bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The house was constructed to a high standard, is well maintained, and in good condition. There are few features externally, which are suitable, or likely to be used by roosting bats; the roof void has no gaps which could give direct access to roosting bats, and no evidence of use was found during the inspection.

Text: 4. Evaluation The lack of any evidence of use inside the roof void, such as droppings or feeding remains, reduces the likelihood of a signiﬁcant roost being present. If bats were present inside the roof void, even in lower numbers, some evidence of use would be likely to persist.

Text: 4. Evaluation Roof and ridge tiles are in good condition, and ridge tiles are sealed with cement. There are no gaps between rooﬁng materials which could be used by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation The walls are solid brick with no insulating cavity. Walls are in good condition, with no cracks, or missing mortar which could be used by crevice dwelling bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Window and door frames are ﬁxed into the brickwork, gaps are ﬁlled with sealant, and offer no suitable roosting opportunities.

Text: 4. Evaluation Wooden fascia boards and boxed sofﬁts at the eaves are ﬁxed tightly against brickwork, with no suitable gaps; wall cavities and boxed sofﬁts open into the roof void, and were inspected from above.

Text: 4. Evaluation The small gaps between brickwork, roof timbers, and rooﬁng materials, in the roof void were inspected in detail using an endoscope. No droppings were found, and no suitable gaps were present which could give access, or shelter to roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Impacts of the work will be limited to the existing ground ﬂoor extension on the east side of the house. The extension is approximately 20 years old, brickwork is in good condition with no suitable cavities. Glass panelled rooﬁng offers no opportunities for roosting bats. The slate roofed section was inspected in detail, and has no gaps suitable for use by roosting bats.

Text: 4. Evaluation Taking into account the habitat surrounding the site, and the features present, the building is unlikely to be used by roosting bats and has negligible suitability for use.

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 4.1. Legal and planning context

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context All species of bats in the UK and their roosts are legally protected by UK and European legislation. The UK the legal protection is summarised as follows:

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context You will be committing a criminal offence if you:

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 1. Deliberately* capture, injure or kill a bat

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 2. Intentionally or recklessly disturb a bat in its roost or deliberately disturb a group of bats

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 3. Damage or destroy a bat roosting place (even if bats are not occupying the roost at the time)

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 4. Possess or advertise/sell/exchange a bat (dead or alive) or any part of a bat

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context 5. Intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a bat roost even if bats are not present at the time

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context *In a court, ‘deliberately’ will probably be interpreted as someone who, although not intending to capture/injure or kill a bat, performed the relevant action, being sufﬁciently informed and aware of the consequence his/her action would most likely have.

Text: 4.1. Legal and planning context If bats or bat roosts are present in the building, the proposed work would likely result in an offence being committed.

Text: Impact assessment Impact assessment

Text: Impact assessment The development proposals are for the consolidation of a side extension, construction of a single story rear extension, and changes to the front porch.

Text: Impact assessment The building has no features which are suitable, or likely, to be used by roosting bats and has negligible suitability for use.

Text: Impact assessment The proposed work is unlikely to impact on bats or bat roosts; and once completed is unlikely to provide any increase in levels of disturbance for bats locally.
