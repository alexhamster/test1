Text: Summary Summary

Text: Summary This report has been prepared by Tyler Grange Group Limited on behalf of Mr and Mrs Campbell. It sets out the findings of a Preliminary Roost Assessment and subsequent nocturnal bat surveys of a property at ‘Park End’, Dunham Massey (centred at OS Grid Reference SJ7403487544), hereinafter referred to as the 'site'. The site is subject to a planning application for the alteration of the north western flat roof section of the building from flat to pitched roof.

Text: Summary S.1.

Text: Summary S.2. The purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of the ecological importance of the site for bats, the potential impact of the proposed development and the required mitigation and suggested enhancements to form a net gain of ecological value.

Text: Summary S.3. Following the Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA), the building was assessed as having moderate bat roost potential, and was subject to an initial two nocturnal surveys, comprising a separate dusk and dawn survey in line with best-practice survey guidelines.

Text: Summary S.4. During these surveys, a small number (2) of soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded roosting within the property. In order to formally characterise the roost in accordance with best-practice guidelines, a third survey was completed. . The two roost locations have been characterized as opportunistic summer day roosts of individual bats.

Text: Summary S.5. Due to the presence of a confirmed roost within the property, it will be necessary for a licence to be obtained from Natural England to allow the proposed works to proceed lawfully. Based on the current characterisation of the roost, it falls within the criteria eligible for a ‘low impact’ or Mitigation Class Licence. The broad mitigation required by this licence is set out in this report, which outlines how the works will be carried out under licence and supervision by a licensed consultant, along with mitigation recommendations to support roosting bats post-development.

Text: Summary S.6. By following the mitigation and enhancement measures outlined within this report the proposed enhancements at the site will also lead to a net gain in roosting opportunities for bat species at the site.

Text: Scope of Works Scope of Works

Text: Scope of Works The surveys followed standard methodologies set out in the Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell, Jones, 2004), the Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004) and Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists - Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016) and comprised:

Text: Scope of Works 2.1

Text: Scope of Works • Desk Study – reviewing online records of bat roosts or presence within the local area gathered from MAGIC;

Text: Scope of Works • Preliminary Roost Assessment (PRA) – ground-level external building inspection survey to assess potential of the building on site to support roosting bats; and

Text: Scope of Works • Detailed Roost Surveys – dusk emergence and dawn re-entry surveys conducted on the building to assess the presence or likely absence of roosting bats.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA)

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) An external inspection of the buildings was undertaken on 11th April 2022 by Dale Mortiboys BSc ACIEEM (Natural England Bat Survey Class Licence CL18).

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.2

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) The weather conditions for the survey were 14°C, dry, light breeze (Beaufort scale 2) and 50% cloud cover.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.3

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) A detailed external inspection of the building at the site was undertaken to determine the presence of live or dead bats, signs of bat use and features that may support bat roosting directly or allow access to features further within the structure of the building.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.4

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) This survey followed standard methodologies outlined within Bat Survey for Professional Ecologists Good Practice Guidelines (Collins 2016), Bat Workers’ Manual (3rd Edition) (Mitchell- Jones, A.J. and McLeish, A.P., 2004) and Bat Mitigation Guidelines (Mitchell-Jones, A.J., 2004).

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.5

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.6 The potential of the building to support roosting bats was categorised against the criteria described in Table 2.1.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Table 2.1: Roost Assessment Criteria (adapted from Collins, 2016)

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Suitability Roosting Habitats Negligible Negligible habitat features on-site likely to be used by roosting bats. A structure with one or more potential roost sites that could be used by individual bats opportunistically. However, these potential roost sites do not provide enough space, shelter, protection, appropriate conditions and/or suitable surrounding habitat to be Low used on a regular basis or by larger numbers of bats (i.e. unlikely to be suitable for maternity or hibernation). A tree of sufficient size and age to contain PRFs but with none seen from the ground or features seen with only very limited roosting potential. A structure or tree with one or more potential roost sites that could be used by bats due Moderate to their size, shelter, protection, conditions and surrounding habitat but unlikely to support a roost of high conservation status roost type. A structure or tree with one or more potential roost sites that are obviously suitable for High use by larger numbers of bats on a more regular basis and potentially for long periods of time due to their size, shelter, protection conditions and surrounding habitat.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) Limitations

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) The building roof void was not inspected internally due to the sparsity of available hatch space in relation to the rotundness of the surveyor. This is not thought to affected the outcomes of this report.

Text: Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment (PRA) 2.7

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys Nocturnal Bat Surveys

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys The building PRA identified potential roost features (PRF’s) to be present and assessed the building as providing ‘moderate’ potential to support roosting bats. In accordance with BCT guidelines, this triggers a requirement for at least two nocturnal roost surveys to establish the presence or likely absence of roosting bats.

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.8

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.9 In line with this guidance, one dusk emergence survey and one dawn re-entry survey were undertaken within the months of May-July 2022, the details of which are available in Table 2.2 below. Survey effort was informed by best practice guidelines (Collins, 2016). During the dawn survey on the 16th June a soprano pipistrelle bat was observed entering the western gable end. This prompted an additional third nocturnal survey to be completed for roost characterisation

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys Four surveyors were positioned around the building to provide adequate coverage of all suitable features – see Plan 15107/RL01b for surveyor locations. Surveyors used a combination of visual observation and echolocation detection to identify and bats emerging from the building, assisted by two-way radios in order to correlate bat movements between surveyors. Survey equipment used comprised Bat loggers, anabat scouts, anabat expresses with Batbox Duets, an echometer touch Pro and an anabat walkabout. The detectors recorded in frequency division and full spectrum formats. Elekon’s Bat Explorer software was used to analyse sonograms of any calls recorded in the field.

Text: Nocturnal Bat Surveys 2.10

Text: Survey Limitations Survey Limitations

Text: Survey Limitations 2.11 The property was not inspected internally. Due to the design of the roof, there were some blind spots to the surveyor caused by roof valleys. These limitations are not considered to have affected the conclusions on determining the level of bat roosting potential.

Text: Survey Limitations 2.12 Bats use a variety of roosts, ranging from maternity, mating or swarming and hibernation roosts, containing many individuals, to mating or night-time feeding roosts containing few individuals or single animals. Bats also tend to be nomadic (although are faithful to certain favoured roosting sites), spending variable lengths of time in a variety of roosts. As a result, even with the considerable survey effort it is possible that small transient roosts of bats may have been missed, although these tend to be less important to bats and so this should not affect the evaluation and recommendations made.

Text: Survey Limitations 2.13 The weather was optimal during the nocturnal surveys and sufficient confidence is therefore placed in the results obtained.

Text: Desk Study Desk Study

Text: Desk Study The desk study for bat records on the wider area revealed no recent bat licence applications within 1km of the site.

Text: Desk Study 3.1.

Text: Desk Study The habitats onsite include a large tree lined garden that borders a woodland close to the Dunham Massey country estate and therefore represents a suitable foraging resource. The garden is not likely to be key for commuting bats. The woodland adjacent to the site is likely to represent a significant foraging resource to bats as well as offering roosting and commuting opportunities.

Text: Desk Study 3.2.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment Preliminary Roost Assessment

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment External

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The building is a late 19th century semi-detached brick build adjacent to the Dunham Massey Park estate. The pitched roof is slate and is generally in a good state of repair. The main ridge runs east to west with shorter dormer pitches to the north and south. The property adjoins the neighbouring house on the western aspect.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.3.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.4. The northern aspect gable end is in good condition with no visible point of potential access in the soffits. A small, sloped porch roof has several slipped and crack tiles offering opportunistic roosting for crevice dwelling species.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The western aspect gable end, eaves and soffits are well sealed, and the two storey flat roof extension shows no sign of bat potential roosting features (PRF). However, the ends of the roof pitch on the western aspect, as well as the southern aspect, show signs of wear at approximately the last two tiles. Due to the positioning, this would create direct access to the roof space, but could offer crevice roosting potential as well.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.5.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.6. The southern area of the roof is more complex with a single storey flat roof extension as well as large dormer pitched roof. The slates and lead flashing around this dormer area, as well as the wider southern roof have several areas of PRFs. These include lifted lead flashing around the chimney and roof valleys, slipped and damaged roof slates and gaps at the ridge tiles. There is also a dual pitched slate roofed outhouse closely situated to the southern extension. This has slipped slates and raised lead flashing. The soffits and eaves of the roof are largely in good condition.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 3.7. Overall, the property is considered to be of moderate potential for bat roosting.

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: Preliminary Roost Assessment The building was of negligible potential for hibernating bats due to lack of open basement or other area of stable thermal mass. Limited number of features occur on the external surfaces of the structure, but these are shallow (e.g. less than 10cm deep). All such features would not, individually, be able to hold more than one or two bats and would not typically be regarded as providing the protection from weather or provide the favourable temperature and humidity conditions required during the winter period

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.9.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.10. Myotis spp., common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, noctule Nyctalus noctula and brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus were recorded throughout the survey. Many recordings relate to relate to foraging behaviour along the tree boundary to the south, and over the garden to the east and south of the site. Other recordings relate to commuting behaviour to the northeast of the house and along the tree line to the south.

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys Dawn Re-entry Survey (16/06/2022)

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.11. Two Soprano Pipistrelle re-entries were recorded on the gable end of southwest facing dormer (Plan: 15107_ECG_300622). The first re-entry was on the end of the roof pitch of southwest facing dormer (RE1 - 04:17). The second re-entry was under end tiles of the southwest facing dormer, on the southern corner (RE2 - 04:26).

Text: Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys 3.12. Myotis spp., common Pipistrelle, and soprano Pipistrelle were also recorded throughout the survey, utilizing the woodland adjacent to the site to the south as a foraging route.

Text: Roost Summary Roost Summary

Text: Roost Summary 3.15. Two locations on the dormer window on the southern (rear) elevation were recorded as having summer day roosts for individual bats. This dormer window is part of the main roof and not part of the roof considered during this planning application. Both flat roof areas of the site were found to have No Roosts Present following the three nocturnal surveys.

Text: Section 4: Implications, Mitigation/Enhancement Strategy and Conclusions Section 4: Implications, Mitigation/Enhancement Strategy and Conclusions

Text: Site Proposals Site Proposals

Text: Site Proposals 4.1. The proposed development will include the repitching of the two storey flat roof section of the property that is in the west of site. This newly created pitched roof will tie in with the main building wall below the existing main pitched roof. As such it will not impact the main roof.

Text: Site Proposals 4.2. The single storey flat roof section on the south of the building will be demolished and a new extension built with a single pitched roof tying in to the main building below the first floor windows.

Text: Site Proposals 4.3. There is a need to reroof the main roof due to poor state of repair. This work does not require planning and is not dealt with directly within this report, however, recommendations relating to works around the main roof/bats roosts are covered to ensure best guidance is available.

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment 4.4. The repitching of the two storey flat roof as covered by the proposed plan ( Plan 2:0014-StA-XX- 00-DR-A-203) would not directly affect a bat roost. In the absence of any mitigation measures, demolition of the existing flat roof would result in no impact to known bat roosts as the flat roof section is separate to the main pitched roof.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.5. The demolition of the single storey flat roof section would not directly impact any known bat roost.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.6. In the absence of any mitigation measures, the alterations to the two flat roof areas on the building would result in no loss of protected bat roosts or shelters. The works would cause no other ecological impacts.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.7. The building on site was noted to contain two individual soprano pipistrelle day roosts. These are located away from the flat roof section considered as the proposals in the report. However, the main roof of the house may require reroofing, so implications are discussed here.

Text: Impact Assessment 4.8. In the absence of any mitigation measures, reroofing of the existing main roof would result in the destruction of a shelter place used by a European Protected Species. Resultantly, a licence from Natural England would be required to allow the demolition of the roof to proceed lawfully. The following section details the mitigation measures required for the lawful demolition of the existing roof under licence. The roost status was determined to fall under the category for the Bat Low Impact Class Licence.

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Mitigation and Enhancement

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement 4.9. Under the Bat Mitigation Guidelines, roosts of the lowest conservation status (i.e., small numbers of common/widespread species) do not require any specific mitigation or replacement roost features.

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: Mitigation and Enhancement Demolition/Construction Phase

Text: Repitching of two storey flat roof area Repitching of two storey flat roof area

Text: Repitching of two storey flat roof area 4.10. The removal of the flat roof section is not required to be supervised by a bat ecologist due to the absence of any bat roost and therefore constraint to this section of the building. If a bat is discovered during the works, works in that locale should stop and ecological advise is to be sought.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Proposed reroof of main roof

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.11. A suitably licensed/qualified bat ecologist will supervise the roofing activity. The area containing the roost will be inspected (with a Mobile Elevated Working Platform [MEWP] utilised where necessary) by the ecologist, assisted with an endoscope if necessary. All areas where roosting bats could be present will be carefully and slowly dismantled. Any roosting bats encountered will either be caught by hand and relocated to one of the boxes on a nearby retained tree or allowed to fly away of their own accord. Once the ecologist is satisfied that all potential roost locations have been destroyed, the demolition works can commence in earnest with no other prescriptions.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.12. Due to the small number of bats seen emerging and the low conservation status of day roosts for soprano pipistrelles there are no seasonal constraints for the works.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.13. There is no recommendation for further mitigation regarding the conversion of the flat roof to pitched and tying in with the existing roof. If the project is delayed beyond 12 months of the date of the surveys, update surveys may be required. In this instance further advice should be sought by a Suitably Qualified Ecologist (SQE).

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Enhancement of the site

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.14. As bats are listed as a European Protected Species (EPS), replacement bat boxes are proposed on nearby trees and/or on the building itself. Boxes should be placed within the mature trees at the south edge of the site. TwoSchwegler 1FF bat boxes (or equivalent) and will be installed prior to the demolition work commencing. Examples of the bat boxes can be seen in Appendix 1.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.15. If considered suitable to the aesthetics of the proposed works built in bat tiles could also be considered. This can be confirmed prior to the Natural England Licence application.

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof Lighting

Text: Proposed reroof of main roof 4.16. Due to the high amounts of foraging activity reported within the site boundary, the lighting scheme for the development must ensure that adjacent habitats which could be used by bats (i.e., woodland to the south) is not lit so bats can continue to forage/commute on-site and around the site’s boundaries. Artificial light spill along green spaces of the site should be avoided, along with the lighting of any of the enhancement bat boxes. This will retain bat foraging and commuting at the site and ensure that roosting provisions are more likely to be utilized. Lighting can be sensor triggered to ensure the garden is both safe to use by residents and suitably dark for retained use by bats.

Text: Conclusions Conclusions

Text: Conclusions 4.17. The proposed development actions that are the key consideration of this report i.e the demolition of the single storey flat roof and the repitching of the two storey flat roof section will result in no direct impact to known bat roosts.

Text: Conclusions 4.18. The required additional reroofing of the main roof (not subject to planning approval) will result in the destruction of a shelter place used by a European Protected Species and will require a licence from Natural England to proceed lawfully. However, due to the low conservation status of the roost, it is anticipated that with the implementation of the mitigation and enhancement measures described above, ecological impacts would be adequately mitigated.

Text: Legislation • The Protection of Badgers Act 1992.

Text: Legislation • The European Council Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Flora and Fauna, 1992, often referred to as the 'Habitats Directive', provides for the pro- tection of key habitats and species considered of European importance. Annexes II and IV of the Directive list all species considered of community interest. The legal framework to protect the species covered by the Habitats Directive has been enacted under UK law through The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended).

Text: Legislation In Britain, the WCA 1981 (as amended) is the primary legislation protecting habitats and spe- cies. SSSIs, representing the best examples of our natural heritage, are notified under the WCA 1981 (as amended) by reason of their flora, fauna, geology or other features. All breed- ing birds, their nests, eggs and young are protected under the Act, which makes it illegal to knowingly destroy or disturb the nest site during nesting season. Schedules 1, 5 and 8 afford protection to individual birds, other animals and plants.

Text: Legislation A2.2

Text: Legislation A2.3 The CRoW Act 2000 strengthens the species enforcement provisions of the WCA 1981 (as amended) and makes it an offence to 'recklessly' disturb a protected animal whilst it is using a place of rest or shelter or breeding/nest site.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.4 The updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was published in July 2021 and sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how these should be applied. It replaces the first National Planning Policy Framework published in March 2012. Paragraph 11 states that:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 “Plans and decisions should apply a presumption in favour of sustainable development.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.5 Section 15 of the NPPF (paragraphs 170 to 177) considers the conservation and enhancement of the natural environment. Paragraph 170 states that planning and decisions should contrib- ute to and enhance the natural and local environment by:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 Park End, Dunham Massey Bat Survey Report

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 “Protecting and enhancing valued landscapes, sites of biodiversity or geological value and soils (in a manner commensurate with their statutory status or identified quality in the development plan);recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside, and the wider benefits from natural capital and ecosystem services – including the economic and other benefits of the best and most versatile agricultural land, and of trees and woodland; and minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity, including by establishing coherent ecological networks that are more resilient to current and future pressures”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.6 Paragraph 171 states that plans should distinguish between the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated sites; allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value; take a strategic approach to maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green infrastructure; and plan for the enhancement of natural capital at a catchment or landscape scale across local authority boundaries.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.7 Paragraph 174 states that in order to protect and enhance biodiversity and geodiversity, plans should:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 a) “Identify, map and safeguard components of local wildlife-rich habitats and wider ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international, national and locally desig- nated sites of importance for biodiversity; wildlife corridors and stepping stones that connect them; and areas identified by national and local partnerships for habitat man- agement, enhancement, restoration or creation; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) promote the conservation, restoration and enhancement of priority habitats, ecological networks and the protection and recovery of priority species; and identify and pursue opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.8 When determining planning applications, Paragraph 175 states that local planning authori- ties should aim to conserve and enhance biodiversity by applying the following principles:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 a) “if significant harm to biodiversity resulting from a development cannot be avoided (through locating on an alternative site with less harmful impacts), adequately miti- gated, or, as a last resort, compensated for, then planning permission should be refused;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) development on land within or outside a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and which is likely to have an adverse effect on it (either individually or in combination with other developments), should not normally be permitted. The only exception is where the bene- fits of the development in the location proposed clearly outweigh both its likely impact on the features of the site that make it of special scientific interest, and any broader impacts on the national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 c) development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees) should be refused, unless there are wholly excep- tional reasons58 and a suitable compensation strategy exists; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 d) development whose primary objective is to conserve or enhance biodiversity should be supported; while opportunities to incorporate biodiversity improvements in and around developments should be encouraged, especially where this can secure measurable net gains for biodiversity.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.9 As stated in paragraph 176 the following should be given the same protection as habitats sites:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 “potential Special Protection Areas and possible Special Areas of Conservation;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 Park End, Dunham Massey Bat Survey Report

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 15107_R01_13th July 2022_ECG_CW

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 b) listed or proposed Ramsar sites; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 c) sites identified, or required, as compensatory measures for adverse effects on habitats sites, potential Special Protection Areas, possible Special Areas of Conservation, and listed or proposed Ramsar sites.”

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), July 2021 A2.10 Paragraph 177 states that the presumption in favour of sustainable development does not apply where development requiring appropriate assessment because of its potential impact on a habitats site is being planned or determined.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate The special historic interest of Dunham Town is linked with the history of the Dunham Massey Estate, which borders the Dunham Town Conservation Area directly to the south; its historic kitchen garden is located within the Conservation Area.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey is situated c.1.5km west of Bowdon in an area of agricultural land. The 100ha park is surrounded by a brick wall which was built 1748-51.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey contains a 17th-century deer park which was remodelled with formal park landscaping from the late-17th to the mid-18th century. It is now a country park enclosing ornamental gardens and is owned by the National Trust.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate In the late 20th Century, a bypass to the village of Dunham was constructed and the wall was rebuilt along the line of the new road between Charcoal Lane and Woodhouse Lane. The wood adjacent to the site was originally part of the estate and still owned by the National Trust

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Dunham Massey Hall is the principal building within the estate and is Grade | listed. It is now a National Trust property and open to the public.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate The building is situated towards the north end of the park. A house was constructed by Sir George Booth on a moated platform in the early part of the C17, probably on or close to the site of an existing building, and this was completed towards the middle of the century.

Text: 2.31 Dunham Massey Estate Gardens are situated on the north, east and south sides of the Hall.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Dunham Town Conservation Area

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Dunham Town is one of the estate villages which historically provided accommodation for the estate’s workers and tenant farmers.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The architectural diversity of the residential buildings in the area ranges from modest terraced cottages to large detached houses. The historic red brick workers’ cottages are characteristically compact in scale with modest, simple detailing.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area Their overall form and appearance has generally changed very little, despite several instances of merging and dividing the buildings internally. This has had some impact on the external appearance and adds to the pleasant patina of age.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The varied arrangement of the buildings - some fronting directly onto the street and others being set further back and sometimes overlapping or at an angle - is indicative of the historic development of the village. The sizes of cottages vary depending on their age: the older buildings originally being slightly smaller and terraced.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The larger houses in the Conservation Area conform to a similar good-quality, modest detail standard.

Text: Dunham Town Conservation Area The group comprising lvy House, The Red House and Big Tree House (located near the site) are especially notable as a concentrated group of these larger buildings, all of which date from a period between the early 18th and mid-19th century when a series of detached houses were constructed across the Dunham Massey estate. The National Trust Stamford Estate houses continue the tradition of uniform paint colours and signage.

Text: 3 Design 31 The brief

Text: 3 Design The proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims;

Text: 3 Design * To sympathetically restore the front of the house, and reflect the neighbours property that has been more sympathetically altered.

Text: 3 Design ¢ To allow the rear of the house to benefit from the garden, and solar gains

Text: 3 Design ¢ Provide a family home that can adapt to future requirements, preventing further alterations.

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front . 3.2 Restoring the front

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The intention would be to replace the flat felt roof with a pitched slate roof. The pitched roof is felt to be more in keeping with the original property and tie in better with the neighbouring dwelling (The Gables).

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The current property has a small integral garage, which is too small to accommodate today’s car. It is proposed to convert this as living space and replace the metal garage door with a timber window designed to be in keeping with the rest of the facade.

Text: . 3.2 Restoring the front The applicant would also like to restore the front porch to how it would have been originally, again matching the neighbours property.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) 3.3 Creating a family home and maximise daylight and views.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The existing kitchen is positioned in the darkest part of the house. The proposal therefore is to make the existing kitchen a utility space and move the kitchen to the centre of the house where it can act as a hub and benefit from direct access and views of the garden.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) To benefit this further it is proposed to convert the current garage space to an open plan family space. This again will benefit from a new double door allowing access to the garden and maximising on daylight.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) It is proposed to replace the poorly designed single storey rear extension on the same footprint, and incorporate the internal courtyard. Whilst the footprint would increase (7%), the increase is an element that is currently not externally visible.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The proposed extension has been designed to incorporate and respect the current outbuilding. Recognising it as part of the original house setting.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) Whilst the proposals seeks to increase the roof space, this is only proposed to improve appearance and the conservation area setting.

Text: 3 Design (cont.) The extension to the rear remains as a single storey, but again replaces the flat felt roof with a pitched roof to be more in keeping with original property whilst providing a contemporary solution.

Text: 1. Introduction This Heritage Statement has been prepared by adapt heritage on behalf of the applicant in connection with a householder planning application for the partial demolition, extension and external alterations (the ‘Proposed Development’) at Park End, Dunham Town (the ‘Application Site’).

Text: 1. Introduction The Application Site is located within the south eastern section of the Dunham Town Conservation Area.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.2

Text: 1. Introduction Under Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council has a statutory duty to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of their conservation areas. The meaning of ‘preservation’ in this context, as informed by case law, is taken to be the avoidance of harm.

Text: 1. Introduction 1.3

Text: 1. Introduction The National Planning Policy Framework (‘NPPF’) (2021) provides the Government’s national planning policy on the conservation of the historic environment. In respect of information requirements for applications, Paragraph 194 states the following:

Text: 1. Introduction 1.4

Text: 1. Introduction “In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.”1

Text: Overview of Historic Development 3.3 Below is an overview of the historic development of the Application Site and the surrounding area.

Text: Overview of Historic Development The village of ‘Donehame’ (Dunham) is first mentioned in the Domesday Book which indicates that the area was settled by at least the 11th century but with potential earlier origins.3 The growth of the village is inherently linked to the Dunham Massey Estate. The village of Dunham Town and the Manor of Dunham Massey were owned by the de Massey family during this time and up into the mid 14th century.4 After a succession of owners, the estate was passed to the Booth family who maintained ownership until the mid-18th century.

Text: Overview of Historic Development Ivy House, Big Tree House and other smaller domestic dwellings. Other additions include Dunham School (1759) and the construction of the Bridgewater Canal (1770s). The 1839 Tithe Map (Figure 3.4) shows many of these dwellings and various surrounding agricultural farmsteads. The parkland of Dunham Massey can be seen to the south. The Application Site itself consists of a rear outbuilding which served the Big Tree House.

Text: Overview of Historic Development 3.6

Text: Overview of Historic Development The accompanying apportionment (1839) confirms that the Application Site, and much of the surrounding area, was owned by the Earl of Stamford who resided at Dunham Massey. The site was partially occupied by Thomas Gibbon (to the front) and John Newton (to the rear).

Text: Overview of Historic Development At some point between 1898 (Figure 3.6) and 1907 (Figure 3.7), the outbuilding on the Application Site was demolished and the grounds of Big Tree House shortened. A pair of semi-detached properties were constructed in its place, forming The Gables and Park End. The 1910 Ordnance Survey (Figure 3.7) shows the two buildings together with smaller outbuildings to the rear. There were few other changes to the surrounding area by the early 20th century.

Text: Significance and Special Interest Significance and Special Interest

Text: Significance and Special Interest The NPPF (2021) defines the significance of a heritage asset as:

Text: Significance and Special Interest “The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.”5

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation Areas

Text: Conservation Areas Conservation areas are designated on the basis of their special architectural or historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Historic England has revised and republished its guidance in respect of conservation areas which provides a framework for the appraisal and assessment of the special interest and significance of a conservation area.

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.5

Text: Special Character and Appearance The Dunham Town Conservation Area and its immediate environs are predominantly rural and agricultural in character, with strong connections to the Dunham Massey Estate. The conservation area includes the original early 18th century Walled Kitchen Garden of Dunham Massey and the parkland forms the southern boundary of the area.

Text: Special Character and Appearance Figure 4.2: Houses to Woodhouse Lane (July 2022)

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.7

Text: Special Character and Appearance The conservation area is characterised by residential use with a mix of modest terraced cottages, larger detached houses with agricultural farmsteads to the outer edges. They principally date to the 18th and 19th centuries and were historically interspersed with supporting communal buildings such as public houses, post office, schools and places of worship. A number of these buildings have since been converted into residential use.

Text: Special Character and Appearance 4.8

Text: Special Character and Appearance The majority of the buildings in the Dunham Town Conservation Area are two storeys and built from red brick with slate roofing. Some properties are rendered and some have been refaced at a later date. According to the Council Appraisal, many of the properties in the area may have originally been white-washed.6 Detailing is relatively restrained and restricted to the larger dwellings such as the Red House with its quoined entrance and gabled pediment. Later buildings in the conservation area, principally from the late 19th century, incorporate a mix of render and red brick with areas of timber patterning.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Summary of Special Interest

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.11 The special character and appearance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area is summarised within the Council Appraisal as:

Text: Summary of Special Interest “The special interest and heritage value of the Dunham Town Conservation Area and the boundary extensions stems primarily from its close links with the Dunham Massey estate, significant parts of which are located within the boundaries of the Conservation Area. Dunham Town has been a testing ground for Dunham Massey improvement initiatives since the 18 th century, most notably as a traditional estate village providing estate workers with homes. The establishment of workers’ accommodation in the village has culminated in a distinctive scale and architectural style, which is especially important for its group impact.”7

Text: Summary of Special Interest 12

Text: Summary of Special Interest Contribution made by the Application Site to the Significance of Dunham Town Conservation Area

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.12 As set out earlier at Section 3, the Application Site originally formed part of the grounds of Big Tree House and partially included an outbuilding that fronted Charcoal Lane. This was demolished and replaced by the present semi-detached houses between 1898 and 1907 known as Park End and The Gables.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.7: Front Elevation to Park End (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.13 Park End is built from red pressed brick to the ground floor with pebbledash render to the first floor with brick quoining detail. The windows are timber casements with a bay window at ground floor. The roof is pitched and constructed from slate with clay ridge tiles. The shared gable has simple timber detailing. There is a central and an off-centre chimneystack to the rear of the building.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.14 In the late 20th century, the original open timber porch has been removed and enclosed with modern brick. A two storey flat roofed extension was added to Park End around the same time and is built from similar materials (red brick/pebbledash) with a small garage door and window above.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.8: Rear Elevation to Park End (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.15 The rear of the building (Figure 4.8) is similar in its design although with a small pedimented gable with simple detailing. At ground floor is a single storey flat roofed modern extension which appears to have been added at the late 20th or early 21st century.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.16 The immediate garden area includes a separate a small brick outbuilding (Figure 4.8) with slate roof and clay ridge tiles which is believed to be contemporary with the date of the building (1898-1907). It includes a door and two window openings.

Text: Summary of Special Interest Figure 4.10: View from Dunham Massey Tennis Club (July 2022)

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.17 The Council Appraisal identifies various buildings which make a positive contribution towards the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation area. The Application Site has not been identified as part of this process.

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.18 In terms of contribution, Park End is typical in its use of materials and employs a standard design from the turn of the century. It is not the work of an architect or designer of note and is not of landmark quality. The building also does not respond to the typical detailing of the conservation area. The building and wider plot is largely screened from much of the conservation area due to its setback position and the mature planting to its boundaries (Figure 4.6). There are filtered views from Charcoal Road (Figure 4.9) and distant and partially obscured views from the Dunham Massey Tennis Club (Figure 4.10).

Text: Summary of Special Interest 4.19 When considering the significance of the area and the contribution made by the existing building on the Application Site, it is considered to make a neutral contribution towards the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Summary of Legislation and National Planning Policy

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.1 Under Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Trafford Council, in determining the submitted full planning application, has a statutory duty to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of their conservation areas. The meaning of ‘preservation’ in this context, as informed by case law, is taken to be the avoidance of harm.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining planning applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.2

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.3 Paragraph 198 requires when considering the impact of development on the significance of a designated heritage asset that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation. ‘Conservation’ is defined by the NPPF as ‘the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance.’8

Text: 5. Impact Assessment Paragraphs 201 and 202 differentiate between ‘substantial’ and ‘less than substantial harm’ and provide a framework for the consideration of harm to the significance of designated heritage assets where it arises, bearing in mind the considerable importance and weight that must be given to the statutory duties of the 1990 Act.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 8

Text: 5. Impact Assessment DLUHC (2021) National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) – Annex 2: Glossary

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.5 Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas, to enhance or better reveal their significance.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.6 Paragraph 207 states that not all elements of a Conservation Area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area should be treated either as substantial harm or less than substantial harm, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area as a whole.

Text: 5. Impact Assessment 5.7 Further details of the heritage legislation, planning policy and guidance for consideration of the Proposed Development is set out in in Appendix 1.

Text: The Proposed Development The Proposed Development

Text: The Proposed Development 5.8 The Proposed Development consists of a full planning application for the partial demolition, extension and external alterations to the existing building at Park End, Dunham Town. This includes:

Text: The Proposed Development • Extension: Demolition of modern extension and replacement with single storey new extension, incorporating the existing outbuilding.

Text: The Proposed Development • External Alterations: Construction of a pitched roof to existing two storey extension and reinstatement of open timber porch.

Text: The Proposed Development 5.9 Further information on the design and appearance of the Proposed Development are set out within the Design and Access Statement prepared by Studio Alt Ltd.

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment 5.10

Text: Impact Assessment This impact assessment employs national advice provided by Historic England as an appropriate framework for analysis, including Historic Environment Good Practice Advice (GPA) in Planning Note 2: Managing Significance in Decision Taking in the Historic Environment (2015), which sets out the importance of good design and response to local distinctiveness for new development in the historic environment. This advice provides a checklist of factors that may influence what will make the scale, height, massing, alignment, materials and proposed use of new development successful in its context.

Text: Proposed Extension Proposed Extension

Text: Proposed Extension 5.11 The Proposed Development involves a number of works to Park End as part of its continued use as a private residential dwelling. The proposals involve the demolition of a modern single storey flat roofed extension at the rear of the building (added in the late 20th century) and its replacement with a new extension (Figure 5.1).

Text: Proposed Extension Figure 5.1: Existing and Proposed Rear Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed Extension 5.12 The proposed extension involves retaining the original outbuilding at the rear, utilising the location of the existing extension and infilling the small

Text: Proposed Extension area in-between. It is single storey and includes a pitched gable and is to be constructed from white render (Figures 5.1 and 5.2).

Text: Proposed Extension 5.13

Text: Proposed Extension The design of the extension has been influenced by the main house and outbuilding, referencing their pitched gables whilst responding to their overall scale and form. The materials, including the use of render and slate, responds to those found to Park End and within the wider conservation area. This helps create a modern yet contextual extension that responds to its context. The openings adopt a more modern aesthetic with large areas of glazing with aluminium surrounds.

Text: Proposed Extension Figure 5.2: Existing and Proposed Side Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed Extension 5.14 The Council Appraisal states the following at Paragraph 4.7.28 in relation to Development Opportunities:

Text: Proposed Extension “Where houses are located on a generous surrounding plot there may be some scope for modest extension providing it does not overpower the main block of the house. Such extensions are evident on some properties throughout the Conservation Area. The densely compacted plots of the cottages on the west side of Woodhouse Lane render these buildings less capable of extension.”

Text: Proposed Extension 5.15 Minor changes are proposed to the outbuilding including replacing the existing modern door and dropping a cill to create two larger windows constructed from aluminium. The existing side modern window is also proposed to be replaced with aluminium.

Text: Proposed Extension 16

Text: Proposed Extension 5.16

Text: Proposed Extension The Proposed Development will not harm or diminish the contribution made by the existing building and Application Site to the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area. The proposed extension replaces an existing one and is subservient in scale and massing to the original building. It accords with the Council Appraisal and maintains a generous plot whilst allowing for a contextual modest extension. The new extension will also not disrupt any principal views to or from Park End. This includes from Charcoal Road and the Dunham Massey Tennis Club.

Text: Proposed External Alterations Proposed External Alterations

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.17 The Proposed Development involves a number of alterations to the front and rear elevations. A new pitched roof is proposed to the existing flat roofed extension which responds to the character and style of the existing building and the existing extension to the neighbouring The Gables. It is proposed to be constructed from slate and clay ridge tiles as per the original roof.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.18 A number of other changes are proposed including the removal of the modern garage door at ground floor and window to the first floor (both within the later extension) and their replacement with matching 3-light timber casement windows (Figure 5.3). The detail of this is to be agreed via condition. These works will maintain the overall character and appearance of Park End.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.19 The Proposed Development involves the reinstatement of the original porch arrangement with timber posts and structure with small brick supporting wall. A new timber external door is also proposed. The designs of both of these are based upon those found at the neighbouring The Gables.

Text: Proposed External Alterations Figure 5.3: Existing and Proposed Front Elevation (Studio Alt)

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.20 As illustrated at Figures 5.1 and 5.2, the Proposed Development involves minimal alterations to the rear and side elevation of the building with the exception of the proposed replacement extension and windows. The only other works are the alteration and replacement of some windows/door openings (with matching timber) to the later two storey extension. The arrangement and design of these are to match the main building and will help improve its overall appearance.

Text: Proposed External Alterations 5.21 As set out above, the Proposed Development will not harm or diminish the contribution made by the existing building and Application Site to the significance of the Dunham Town Conservation Area. The proposals present an opportunity to remove negative additions and reinstate lost original architectural features to the main building. This has the ability to improve the contribution made by the existing building to the significance of the conservation area,

Text: National Planning Policy National Planning Policy

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) The National Planning Policy Framework (2021)

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) requires that great weight is given to the conservation of designated heritage assets and this reflects the statutory duty of the 1990 Act with respect to listed buildings and conservation areas. Conservation is defined by the NPPF as “the process of maintaining and managing change to heritage assets in ways that sustain and where appropriate, enhance their significance.”9

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 197 of the NPPF elaborates that local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) assets, putting them into viable uses consistent with their conservation, as well as the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 198 requires when considering the impact of a Proposed Development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, that great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation and the more important the asset, the greater that weight should be. Significance can be harmed or lost through alteration or destruction of the heritage asset or development within its setting. As heritage assets are irreplaceable, any harm or loss requires clear and convincing justification.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 201 states that where a Proposed Development will lead to substantial harm to or total loss of significance of a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent, unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm and or loss is necessary to achieve substantial benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following apply:

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) “the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) • no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) • conservation by grant-funding or some form of charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use”

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 202 requires that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) 21

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including securing its optimum viable use.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 206 requires that local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas, to enhance or better reveal their significance.

Text: The National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Paragraph 207 states that not all elements of a Conservation Area will necessarily contribute to its significance. Loss of a building (or other element) which makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area should be treated either as substantial harm under paragraph 201 or less than substantial harm under paragraph 202, as appropriate, taking into account the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area as a whole.

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) The Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy was adopted on 26 January 2012. Policy R1 – Historic Environment provides detailed policies for proposals affecting heritage assets. It states:

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) “R1.1 All new development must take account of surrounding buildings styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) R1.2 Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings; in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.”

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) In relation to Conservation Areas, the policy (R1.3) states that the Council will:

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) “Determine applications for demolition, taking account of the contribution made by the building or structure to the character, appearance, or special architectural interest of the area as a whole, including the merits of any proposed (re)development. Where development is to follow demolition, it will be a requirement that detailed planning permission for the proposed redevelopment shall be obtained and the implementation of that proposal is secured before the existing building or structure is demolished.

Text: Trafford Local Plan: Core Strategy (2012) Require developers to demonstrate how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the Conservation Area, and its wider setting in the light of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and area specific guidance notes.”

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that:

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: “In addition to preserving or enhancing Conservation Areas, the Council will identify, preserve, protect and enhance the positive features and characteristics of Trafford’s historic environment, through the Land Allocations DPD, the maintenance of the Historic Environment Record, the preparation of local lists, Supplementary Planning Documents and development briefs, as appropriate.”

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: Policy R1.6 of the Core Strategy requires the following:

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: “Accordingly developers will be required, where appropriate, to demonstrate how their development will protect, preserve and enhance the following heritage assets including their wider settings:

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Listed buildings;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Buildings and structures identified on a local list which make a significant contribution to the townscape by reason of their architectural or historic interest;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Listed buildings and locally significant historic buildings and structures, identified on a local list, which are at risk;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: 22

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Sites included on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Scheduled Monuments;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Sites of archaeological significance;

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • Other sites of significant historic designed landscapes identified from the Trafford Urban Historic Landscape Characterisation Report on a local list; and

Text: Policy R1.5 of the Core Strategy states that: • The character of prominent skylines, particularly those running from Dunham New Park to Oldfield Road, Altrincham and from the A56 through Bowdon and any other important skylines, identified through the Conservation Appraisals.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Whilst not planning policy the Planning Practice Guidance provides a clear indication of the Government’s approach to the application of national policy contained in the NPPF. Where there is conflict between the guidance in the PPG and earlier documents the PPG will take precedence.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Historic England Advice Note 1: Conservation Area Appraisal, Designation and Management (2019)

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 The guidance provides information on conservation area appraisal, designation and management to assist in implementing historic environment legislation, planning policy and guidance The guidance states that change is inevitable, and often beneficial, and this advice sets out ways to manage change in a way that conserves and enhances the character and appearance of historic areas. Conservation areas can contribute to sustainable development in all its three dimensions as outlined in the NPPF.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 This note is not a statement of Government policy but supports the implementation of national government policy. It provides advice on assessing the significance of heritage assets and the impact of proposals on that significance.

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 Historic England Advice Note 12: Statements of Heritage Significance: Analysing Significance in Heritage Assets (2019)

Text: National Planning Policy Guidance, 2019 The guidance covers the NPPF requirement for applicants for heritage and other consents to describe heritage significance to help local planning authorities to make decisions on the impact of proposals for change to heritage assets. Understanding the significance of heritage assets, in advance of developing proposals for their buildings and sites, enables owners and applicants to receive effective, consistent and timely decisions. The advice note explores the assessment of significance of heritage assets as part of a staged approach to decision-making in which assessing significance precedes designing the proposal(s).
