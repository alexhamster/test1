Text: Quarry Location St Bees quarry is situated on the west coast of Cumbria, where stone has been quarried and processed for hundreds of years. It is a prominent feature in both local buildings and is also an ideal match for the stone work originally used around the Liverpool and North Wales area.

Text: Quarry Location Due to the quality and durability of the quarried block, Cumbrian Stone’s St Bees Sandstone products can now be found on projects across all areas of the UK.

Text: Technical Data *Please note that as natural stone is a natural product there can be variations in the composition of the stone that would result in these test results varying across the raw material. These results are an average taken from the testing of multiple samples taken from several quarried blocks. Cumbrian Stone would always recommend consulting a structural engineer to establish the minimum required properties where natural stone is being used for structural purposes, and the results contained on this sheet are not to be taken as a structural recommendation in any case.
