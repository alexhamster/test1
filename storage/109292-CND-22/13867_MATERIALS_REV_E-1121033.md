Text: Stonework Stonework

Text: Stonework The existing stone has been identified as a yorkstone pitched faced walling stone, the images below show the stone from both the front, side and rear elevations.

Text: Stonework As you can see in the images above it’s a traditional stretcher bond, due to the varying lengths in the stonework it provides quite an uneven and non-uniform look in parts.

Text: Stonework 1 | P a g e

Text: Stonework The masoned corners to each reveal or return stone is something that is evident in the existing openings. (Please see attached image). The proposed stonework and alterations to the existing facades is to replicate this, the reveals and corners are to look like a fine tooled finish rather than a sawn finish. Also the mortar to be used on proposed elements of the development is to be lime based mortar.

Text: Stonework Please see image above of samples of the proposed stonework on site. As previously mentioned its Yorkstone pitched faced walling stone. There is to be a variety of heights and lengths to match and tie into the existing coursing, ensuring the existing and proposed elements are seamless.

Text: New Pointing - Recessed joint: New Pointing - Recessed joint:

Text: New Pointing - Recessed joint: Working method: This is an extra raked joint. The mortar is applied 2 to 5 mm deeper than the visible surface of the facade. Effect: The emphasis is laid on the horizontal aspect of the facade, especially in combination with full vertical head joints or even no vertical head joints at all. This is to match existing pointing on the building.

Text: Retaining Walls Retaining Walls

Text: Retaining Walls The existing material used for the retaining walls is a reconstituted stone with Yorkstone aggregates. The lengths and heights of each brick is identical, creating a uniform stretcher bond.

Text: Retaining Walls Please see image above of samples of the proposed material for the retaining walls on site. The proposed best match material to use is Marshalls Cromwell Stone Walling with a weathered appearance. The chosen material is not only suitable as it matches the existing it also gives the benefit of being suitable for load-bearing and non-load-bearing use, and has low water absorption, ensuring the high-quality appearance is maintained over a long-term period. The wall coping is also to match existing and is available in the Cromwell range to match the proposed walling stone.

Text: Extract and Soil vent Terminations Where possible all vents (Soil vent pipe terminations and M&E extract vents) will be terminated using a Nature vent slate roof vent.

Text: Extract and Soil vent Terminations Nature Vent is probably one of the most versatile Natural Slate Ventilators available on the market today. Nature Vent will match perfectly with any slate simply by using a piece of the same slate, cut on site and fitted into the bottom section. No unsightly plastic ‘mushrooms’ to spoil the roof, just a discreet grill, coloured to blend into the finished roof. These natural slate vents can be used for the termination of soil vents or extractor fans (with optional flexi pipe) or to simply ventilate the roof void. Developed by one of Europe's foremost producers of roof ventilation products, Nature Vent is manufactured from UV stabilised material, using design technology developed proven and tested during more than 30 years of experience in this specialised field.
