Text: Executive Summary Executive Summary

Text: Executive Summary This application seeks to transform a central Altrincham site which spans 70-72 George Street and 1 Central Way. It will introduce a vital mixed-use proposal, that will deliver a (currently) under- represented Grade A office experience within the heart of Altrincham town centre, aimed at attracting and securing high skilled Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) looking to upscale from remote working or identify satellite offices outside the City Centre that reduce the need for commuting.

Text: Executive Summary Together with vibrant, flexible floorspace for town centre uses at ground and lower floors the scheme will provide a number of direct and linked economic benefits for the town centre.

Text: Executive Summary Located within a central and sustainable location, the application site is juxtaposed between the popular Market Hall and the key retail frontage of George Street. The application site provides an exciting opportunity to extend the transformation of Central Way and improve connectivity to the main retail element of the town.

Text: Executive Summary The site currently presents as a poor quality, visually intrusive property which detracts from the quality of the George Street Conservation Area. Alongside the contribution to the economy of the Town Centre, the proposal will deliver a significant improvement to the aesthetics of the site, and will deliver a positive legacy project supporting additional jobs to the benefit of the local economy.

Text: Executive Summary The key planning considerations at this site relate to the design response to the individual character of the site, and the associated enhancement of the Conservation Area.

Text: Background to the Proposals Background to the Proposals

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.7. Altrincham Town Centre has seen significant investment over recent years. Following some very difficult years during the global recession, regeneration activity was prompted by the Council’s ‘Altrincham Strategy’ which was published in July 2014. Major projects followed in the form of the Council’s £600,000 investment in the reinvention of Altrincham Market as a unique artisan market; the £19 million transport interchange which reopened in December 2014, and the new Altrincham Hospital which re-opened in April 2015. In more recent times a joint agreement between TMBC and Bruntwood has seen the redevelopment of the former Rackhams store commence and TMBC have also bought Grafton Mall with a view to future redevelopment.

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.8. Public realm works have brought shared space to key areas of the town centre and transformed the appearance and function of key routes. 2019 saw the new £20m Wellbeing Centre open on the site of the former Altrincham Hospital, which included a new £2 million library.

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.9. Projects continue to gather pace with various other commercial and residential schemes ongoing in the town. As the next chapter in the Town’s regeneration, there are emerging proposals for redevelopment of the Grafton Centre (currently a shopping arcade, a Travelodge and other retail units) and work has also commenced on a new residential, commercial, and car park Development at Chapel Square. the

Text: Background to the Proposals 1.10. The proposed development will play its part in this regeneration process, delivering an efficient use of this central brownfield site, and in a location where the redevelopment of the site will offer an improvement to the Conservation Area.

Text: Altrincham Office Market Altrincham Office Market

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.11. The applicant has been working with Altrincham based agents, RPS, who have comprehensive experience facilitating commercial transactions in and around Altrincham.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.12. Underpinning the case for this proposal is the commercial view that there is a very limited supply of smaller suites of Grade A office accommodation within the town centre. This mismatch is evidenced by analysis of supply against the known requirement that was prepared and submitted as part of the pre-application consultation.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.13. As part of this suite of information, a schedule of available supply was prepared is attached at Appendix 1. It confirms that much of the currently available office space is refurbished office spaces, with only three buildings meeting the ‘Grade A’ status, namely Vertex, Air and Chapel Square.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.14. Altrincham based agents RPS identified a need for high quality modern offices within a central town centre location. The lack of readily available office floorspace has resulted in occupiers locating in other centres including Didsbury and Wilmslow. This is reflected in average rents and lease terms, which are comparable with Manchester City Centre.

Text: Altrincham Office Market 7

Text: Altrincham Office Market 1.15. To address this imbalance, the proposals are designed to appeal to small professional businesses that want to be based in Altrincham as opposed to the City Centre, and that want to benefit from working in Grade A office space in a market town location. This is particularly desirable in a post Covid market.

Text: Application Site Application Site

Text: Application Site 2.1. Wholly within the administrative area of Trafford Borough Council, the application site area measures c.0.3 ha. The site forms a broadly rectangular shaped block that encompasses 70-72 George Street with a frontage to the southeast through to 1 Central Way which borders the northwest of the building. The site also incorporates a 1970s ginnel which runs along the northern boundary, providing a direct north/south pedestrianised link.

Text: Application Site 2.2. The application site adjoins neighbouring properties to the south, comprising the Everyman Theatre to 74 George Street, which also links through to Central Way. The Bricklayers Arms public house is beyond the 1970s ginnel to the north.

Text: Application Site 2.3. George Street is the principal pedestrianised shopping street in Altrincham Town Centre. It spans from the junction with Regent Road and the Grafton Centre in a north easterly direction as far as the modern shopping centre of the Stamford Building. The site therefore occupies a pivotal location within the Town Centre. Its redevelopment will markedly contribute towards the revitalisation of this evolving part of the Town Centre.

Text: Application Site 2.4. Central Way has historically had a less prominent position but has experienced growth in recent years attributed in part to the success of Altrincham market. It has now benefitted from artisan style operators selling locally sourced product from pagoda style units facing the subject property.

Text: Application Site Figure 1 l View towards the application site from Central Way, prior to inclusion of meanwhile uses.

Text: Application Site 10

Text: Application Site 11

Text: Application Site 2.5. The existing buildings comprise two retail units fronting onto George Street and a temporary ‘pop up’ food and drink outlet fronting onto Central Way. The upper floors of the three-storey building, fronting Central way, are occupied by a martial arts school who pay a nominal rent to reflect the poor condition of the roof and the building generally. At this point the building is two storey in height under a flat roof with the ground floor space being an open void.

Text: Application Site 2.6. As shown opposite, the building is in a poor state of repair and at risk of dereliction. The ‘pop up’ food offer only accommodates the vacant area underneath the building where it fronts Central Way. Prior to this, the building suffered vandalism and antisocial behaviour.

Text: Application Site 2.7. The building’s height rises towards Central Way, which utilises the natural topography of the application site, sloping quite steeply upwards from George Street towards the north/Central Way by approximately 2.5m. Access to the application site can be taken by pedestrians via George Street and vehicle access from Central Way.

Text: Application Site 2.8. The site is within the Environment Agency Flood Zone 1, which is at a low risk of flooding, including from surface water.

Text: Application Site 2.9. There are no trees within the application site, which is wholly occupied by built form and hardstanding.

Text: Application Site Figure 3 l View towards the application site from George Street

Text: Surrounding Area Surrounding Area

Text: Surrounding Area 2.10. The application site is within the George Street Conservation Area and also abuts the Old Market Place Conservation Area to the north (Central Way elevation).

Text: Surrounding Area 2.11. There is no clear local vernacular or building style present in Altrincham Town Centre, or the George Street Conservation Area. The style of architecture in the vicinity is broad comprising a mix of 18th and 19th Century buildings and modern late 20th and early 21st Century commercial premises. Building heights along the street also vary from two storeys up to eight storeys.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.12. The Town Centre location benefits from high levels of accessibility, with access to a wide variety of public and private transport connections. Located within a five minute walk of Altrincham Transport Interchange, the site is highly accessible to the mainline railway, Metrolink and bus services in addition to a cycle hub and therefore has excellent public transport connections to the rest of Trafford, Greater Manchester and the North West.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.13. As part of the Town Centre, the application site plays an important role in the wider Borough, which serves a district population in excess of 210,000. Approximately 410,800 people live within 6 miles of the town centre, extending to 2.3 million people within 12 miles.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.14. Altrincham and the adjacent residential areas of Hale, Hale Barns and Bowdon are particularly popular, due to a combination of excellent educational facilities, good quality housing stock and ready access to excellent shopping and leisure facilities; all within a very short commuting distance of Manchester City Centre.

Text: Surrounding Area 2.15. These characteristics, coupled with the Metrolink, train station, proximity to Manchester Airport, major motorway networks and a high quality independent leisure scene, support our view that the town of Altrincham has the potential to be a leading sub-market for commercial development within South Manchester.

Text: Allocations Allocations

Text: Allocations 2.16. Within the defined town centre, the site is also identified as being within the George Street Conservation Area, which relates to Supplementary Planning Document SPD5.1, Conservation Area Appraisal (2014).

Text: Allocations 2.17. The application site is not listed, nor is it adjacent to any listed buildings, or within the visual context of a listed building. The Bricklayers Arms, which is adjacent to the site, is identified as a positive contributor within the Conservation Area Appraisal, and the accompanying text explains that this annotation identifies a ‘non- designated heritage asset’.

Text: Allocations 2.18. The application site is also identified within the Altrincham Town Centre Neighbourhood Business Plan as being within a ‘Mixed Use with Ground Floor Active Frontages’ allocation.

Text: Allocations 2.19. It is not within any other designations as identified within the Proposals Map.

Text: Planning History Planning History

Text: Planning History 2.20. The Planning History of the site is at Appendix 2. This demonstrates the commercial nature of the site, with advertisement consent sought and applications relating to signage and changes of use over the years.

Text: Planning History 2.21. There are no historic applications relating to the redevelopment of the site available to view online.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.22. The Applicant engaged in preapplication consultation with the LPA, which included feedback from other internal consultees in relation to heritage, highways, waste management, ecology, flood archaeology, and environmental health. risk,

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.23. The preapplication feedback, which was informed by a meeting and also a written response, confirmed that in principle the redevelopment of the site was acceptable, with key benefits and aesthetic improvements recognised. Detailed comments related predominantly to issues of design and any impact on the Conservation Area.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.24. In response, changes have been made to the design. These are explained in detail within the Design and Access Statement:

Text: Preapplication Consultation • The proposed height has been reduced to provide a three to four storey building, with the design giving the appearance of a three-storey property to both Central Way and George Street.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Additional space has been proposed within a semi-basement area, to deliver the size needed whilst reducing the height above ground and making effective use of the site’s topography.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • The design has also incorporated a stepped back upper level, so that the upper floor will have a reduced visual impact from the street scene to Central Way.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Attention has been paid to the 1970s ginnel, with openings provided to allow for a more active frontage and provide natural surveillance.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 2.25. In summary, it is considered that the detailed feedback has been considered and acted upon through this submitted proposals to ensure a sensitive design response to this central site.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 14

Text: Preapplication Consultation Proposed

Text: Preapplication Consultation Development

Text: Preapplication Consultation 15

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.1. The proposed development presents the opportunity to redevelop the previously developed site to provide a high-quality intervention befitting its pivotal position within the Town Centre.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.2. In its current form this brownfield site has been a blight on the amenity of Central Way, detracts from the character and appearance of the site, and contributed very little to the local economy, with periods of occupation by short term and temporary uses and vacancy despite being marketed, demonstrating no prospect of occupation in its current form.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.3. Whilst the ground floor to Central Way now has food and beverage uses incorporated, they are not within a permanent structure and therefore, only have a short lease arrangement. This means the benefit they currently provide to the street-scene and vitality of the town centre is not a long-term solution. It does not maximise the site’s potential. The proposal seeks to directly address this with an active and permanent mix of uses appropriate to the site’s central location.

Text: Preapplication Consultation Figure 5 l Proposed visual viewed from Central Way

Text: Preapplication Consultation 16

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.4. The key principles that have underpinned the concept and design approach to the site can be defined as:

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Introduction of high-quality Grade A office accommodation within the Town Centre as part of a mixed-use redevelopment.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Diversification of Altrincham’s commercial offer, providing direct and indirect employment opportunities and increasing activity throughout the week.

Text: Preapplication Consultation Introducing a bespoke and tailored office environment to Altrincham Town Centre aimed at attracting and securing high skilled Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME).

Text: Preapplication Consultation •

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Delivering a highly sustainable commercial building, exceeding the targets set by the current Building Regulations Part L2A.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Creation of an aspirational and attractive, active leisure frontage to Central Way, bolstering the level of activity started by the adjacent Everyman Theatre.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Retention and improvement of pedestrian connectivity between George Street, Central Way and the Market, enhancing the pedestrian experience/ public realm along the 1970s ginnel.

Text: Preapplication Consultation • Replacement building of a quality and design to make a positive contribution to the George Street Conservation Area when viewed from Central Way compared to the status quo.

Text: Preapplication Consultation 3.5. The demolition of the existing buildings will facilitate redevelopment of the site to deliver a new purpose-built building around a central courtyard. the

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Proposed Use and Amount

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.6. The proposal seeks to secure full planning permission for 7,543 sq m (81,192 sqft) gross office space and 5,758 sq.m (61,978 sq ft) gross for flexible use for either retail and/or financial and professional services and/or restaurants and cafes and/or gymnasium or fitness studio (all Use Class E) and/or a drinking establishment (Sui Generis Use Class).

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 17

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Scale

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.7 The submitted plans propose a part three/part four storey building (with the use of the topography to provide a basement floor). This proposed massing has been carefully considered and responds directly to the preapplication feedback from the LPA that the height must be in keeping with the surrounding context. This design approach is considered appropriate, noting the character of George Street, which includes a variety of heights. Specifically, the proposed development will sit lower in height than 85 to 87 George Street opposite the site, and 66 George Street directly to the north.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.6. Within the immediate context, the two and three storey retail frontages are interspersed with taller key/landmark buildings, including the Travel Lodge (8 storeys), The Well Being Centre and Library (4 storeys), Marks and Spencer (3 storeys plus projecting plant area) and Clarendon House, Stamford Quarter (7 storeys).

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.7. The proposed scale and roof shape takes away the height and mass of the accommodation from where it would be viewed from George Street in brief glimpses. There is also a focus to enable much needed visual improvements to the Central Way frontage. The stepped shape to the upper floor further reduces the visual impact of this level.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Figure 7 l Proposed Street Scene – dashed line indicating approximate line of existing buildings opposite.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Figure 8 l Proposed ‘Courtyard’ Elevation

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 19

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.8. The height of the building is considered appropriate in its response to preapplication feedback, and within its visual context. It is sufficiently tall to allow an appropriate quantum of floor space, utilising the natural levels to add a basement level.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount Layout

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.9. The layout of the proposed building responds to commercial agency advice and focuses on providing a new “offer” resolving the current mismatch between the existing stock and the requirements for high calibre office occupiers. It also considers the preapplication response to seek to deliver the quality and quantum required within the parameters set by planning policy.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.10. The proposed ground floor layout positively addresses George Street, Central Way with retail or leisure uses to the ground floor and with active use of the 1970s ginnel to the north.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.11. Connectivity and passive surveillance along the pedestrian ginnel forms a key element of the design response to the layout, reflecting application advice. As illustrated by the submitted plans (Elevations 01), the proposed replacement unit will provide windows to the side elevation from George Street, a ramp and staircase to provide access into the unit and the open terraced and naturally landscaped area, and also a large glazed window above glazed pavement lights to Central Way.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.12. This delivers an active frontage towards the Bricklayers Arms to facilitate a welcoming pedestrian connection, and a vast improvement over the existing situation.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.13. At the ground floor frontage to George Street, flexible retail floorspace is proposed which would be capable of occupation by a range of appropriate town centre uses. The layout seeks to maximise its appeal to potential tenants and its contribution to the vibrancy and vitality of the Town Centre.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.14. The unit fronting Central Way is proposed to accommodate a leisure use, with large, glazed windows creating an active frontage and delivering natural light into the unit.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.15. The office accommodation would be accessed separately via a landscaped terraced area within the central section of the building.

Text: Proposed Use and Amount 3.16. Upper floors would be connected around a single central circulation stair and lift core, providing net internal floorplates of 90 sqm – 133 sqm and incorporating WCs (including accessible facilities).

Text: Access Access

Text: Access 3.17. The site is highly accessible and focusses on providing high quality, well designed secure cycle facilities, encouraging active modes of transport for both employees and visitors to the site.

Text: Access 3.18. New car parking spaces are not proposed, reflective of the site’s central and sustainable position. This approach was supported at the preapplication stage, with Highways Officers recognising the wide range of alternative ways of access the site other than the private car.

Text: Access 20

Text: Access 3.19. Whilst there are level changes across the site, level access is achieved to both the ground floor commercial accommodation and access to all upper floors is by passenger lift and staircase with accessible WC facilities provided on each floor. The development will be designed in accordance with the Disability and Discriminations Act and with the current Building Regulations at the time of building.

Text: Landscape and Public Realm Landscape and Public Realm

Text: Landscape and Public Realm 3.20. High quality public realm interventions will ensure increased connectivity and pedestrian footfall along the existing 1970s ginnel, drawing prospective customers through the Town Centre and enlivening a well used connection.

Text: Landscape and Public Realm 3.21. A landscape and public realm scheme for the Central Way frontage and ginnel are submitted (ref Plan (PL)LS01) to ensure there is a synergy with the improvements to the markets and Central Way.

Text: Servicing Servicing

Text: Servicing 3.22. Servicing for units along George Street is currently via Central Way. This arrangement is proposed to remain as existing, but with refuse and re- cycling storage proposed within the ground floor area within the central part of the site allowing for 2 No. 1100L Euro-Bins. These will be accessible via the ginnel to enable access, and are identified within the submitted Waste Management Strategy.

Text: Appearance Appearance

Text: Appearance 3.23. The external appearance of the development has been carefully considered, both in terms of its immediate context and views into the site from surrounding Conservation Areas.

Text: Appearance 3.24. The development seeks to provide a high-quality design and appearance. Contemporary architecture is not discouraged by planning policy, and pastiche design is often resisted in conservation areas. The architectural approach has therefore sought to ensure a balance is struck between providing a confident addition to the street scene and referencing the historic environment through materiality.

Text: Appearance 3.25. The use of an outdoor terrace area introduces a new green space and open area within the central core of the proposed replacement building. This is more in keeping with the area, linking to existing public realm improvements, than the living wall concept presented at the preapplication stage.

Text: Material Palette Material Palette

Text: Material Palette 3.26. The site’s location within the George Street Conservation Area, and abutting the Old Market Conservation Area, has influenced the proposed choice of materials. The Conservation Area Management Plan makes reference to the use of brick within the Conservation Area, with glazed elements evident in numerous locations throughout the locality, and this was reflected in the feedback from the Local Planning Authority at the preapplication stage. This is detailed further within Section 5.

Text: Material Palette 21

Text: Material Palette 3.27. The proposal utilises a hierarchic approach to fenestration, reflective of examples in the vicinity. The glazing will offer generous national light to internal users.

Text: Material Palette 3.28. Full details of the materials and the design philosophy are incorporated within the Design and Access Statement and assessed within the Heritage Statement.

Text: Principle of Development 5.2. The principle of extending and reconfiguring the existing buildings at George Street and Central Way is considered to be acceptable in principle, subject to detailed design and other considerations. These are investigated and assessed within this Chapter.

Text: Principle of Development 5.3. The proposed development directly addresses key objectives of the Core Strategy and the Neighbourhood Plan, including delivering premises that will attract independent retailers providing goods not easily available online, including food.

Text: Principle of Development 5.4. The Neighbourhood Plan identifies that George Street is a ‘mixed use with ground floor active frontage’

Text: Sustainability Sustainability

Text: Sustainability 5.5. Policy L5, Climate Change requires new development to consider how waste can be minimised and sustainability promoted. Sustainability is a cornerstone of the proposed design. The building has been designed to ensure lower carbon emissions than the targets required by the current Building Regulations Part L2A.

Text: Sustainability 5.6. The building will be efficiently designed and follow the “Lean, Clean, Green” hierarchy to maximise the use of daylight and natural resources, minimising energy use and reducing carbon emissions to a minimum.

Text: Sustainability 5.7. The proposed development has been thermally modelled and renewable, low energy, air source heat pumps, efficient heat recovery ventilation systems and controllable daylight dimmed LED lighting is proposed to maintain excellent environmental conditions all year round.

Text: Sustainability 5.8. Water consumption will be minimised with dual flush WC cisterns and other water saving controls. In addition, there will be blue roof technology to attenuate rainwater run off into the mains drainage system.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Heritage Impact Assessment

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.9. The site is within the George Street Conservation Area, and entrance to Central Way also fronts onto Old Market Place Conservation Area. Paragraph 194 of the NPPF requires the decision maker to incorporate an assessment of the impact on both of these designated heritage assets.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.10. Core Strategy Policy R1, Historic Environment, requires new development to be assessed to ensure that any harm to the significance of a heritage asset is considered. This is supported by Saved Policy ENV21, Conservation Areas, which requires new development to preserve and enhance the Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.12 Input from Heritage Consultants Turley since design inception has identified that the buildings in their current form do not benefit the character of the George Street Conservation Area. This is supported by the George Street Conservation Area Appraisal which identifies the site as ‘having potential for enhancement’, specifically identifying the application site fronting onto Central Way. Consequently, the approach to the massing, scale and appearance has been informed by an understanding of the historic significance of the Conservation Areas.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.13 The Heritage Statement confirms that the existing building to the rear of 70-72 George Street and the area beneath it is noted by the Conservation Area Appraisal as being ‘particularly intrusive. It is identified as having potential to be redeveloped, subject to the new development reflecting the architectural and historic interest of the area and not having a detrimental effect on the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.14 The Heritage Statement states that the existing building on the site, whilst being broadly in keeping with the prevalent scale of surrounding properties, is identified as having a neutral impact on the George Street Conservation Area. The impact of that element fronting onto Central Way is also noted as having a neutral impact on the Old Market Conservation Area.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.15 Analysis of historic mapping shows that Central Way was constructed in the 1970s, and it is therefore a modern insertion to the Conservation Area. Buildings on Central Way comprise ad hoc additions and buildings associated with those fronting onto George Street, rather than forming a defined and intentional built edge.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.16 It is also noted that the ginnel at the northern edge of the site is a modern addition, it was formed when the existing buildings, numbers 70 and 72 George Street, were constructed around 1970.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 27

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.17 Redevelopment of the site presents an opportunity for enhancement because the existing building on George Street has been identified to have a neutral contribution to the Conservation Area and facing Central Way the site is identified as a negative element in the street-scene.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.18 Based on the Heritage Statement’s assessment of the significance and the setting of nearby heritage assets, it is concluded that there would be no harm to the identified Conservation Areas. The amendments made following preapplication discussions to reduce the proposed height and massing together with this assessment mean that the Proposed Development will meet the objectives of Paragraphs 197, 199 and 206 of the NPPF and the requirements of s.72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 can be satisfied if Trafford Council grants planning permission.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment 5.19 Moreover, there are benefits that will arise from the proposal to weigh in the planning balance and they are considered to include:

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Introduction of a high quality bespoke building into Altrincham Town Centre.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Delivery of grade A office floorspace.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Job creation.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Removal of an unattractive vacant building on Central Way.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment • Enhancement of the ginnel to benefit accessibility within the town centre and to reinforce the historic building line.

Text: Heritage Impact Assessment Introduction of passive surveillance to the town centre.

Text: Design Design

Text: Design 5.20 Saved Policy S6, Development in Altrincham Town Centre requires new development to be of a high quality, with public realm considered as part of the overall proposal. The detail of the design will be assessed against Core Strategy Policy L7, Design, which requires new development to be appropriate within its wider context in terms of scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevational treatment, materials and hard and soft landscaping.

Text: Design 5.21 The full detail of the proposed design is addressed within the submitted Design and Access Statement. In summary, the Applicant has sought preapplication advice and acted positively upon this to amend plans to incorporate feedback. Specifically, the height now proposed is lower in response, and utilises the levels of the site to deliver a design with varied heights, and an open courtyard area to accommodate green space.

Text: Design 5.22 Further changes following preapplication feedback includes the introduction of a courtyard area to provide a landscaped area. This will replace the living wall initially proposed and enables the development to have outside space for future staff and visitors. This area will also incorporate cycle storage spaces.

Text: Design 5.23 The scale and massing of the proposal appropriately responds to the key frontages of George Street and Central Way, with open space providing an interesting frontage to the 1970s ginnel, allowing circulation around the building and retaining pedestrian links.

Text: Design 28

Text: Design 5.24 A key objective of the Altrincham Town Centre Neighbourhood Business Plan is to enable the centre to evolve into an economically, environmentally, and socially attractive and dynamic centre. This is supported through Policy ‘D’ Design and Quality, which requires new development to be of a high quality design, with the scale appropriate to its location and setting. This is emphasised within the National Design Guide (2019) which recognises the flexibility required to deliver vital and viable town centres.

Text: Design 5.25 New proposals must demonstrate how they respond to the Character Areas identified with the Supplementary Design Document. This document identifies the site within the Mixed-Use Historic Area. This identifies materials including brick, red and buff sandstone, terracotta and glazed ceramic, black and white Cheshire vernacular and Welsh blue/grey or Westmorland green slates.

Text: Design 5.26 The Neighbourhood Plan specifically notes that proposals that improve an historic town centre ginnel will be encouraged and supported.

Text: Design 5.27 The submitted Waste Management Plan also prepared by Eden Planning demonstrates that sufficient space it allocated for the storage of waste on site. Space is provided for the separation of recyclables and a clear way, via the ginnel to Central Way where bins can be collected in the same manner as other properties on Central Way.

Text: Amenity Amenity

Text: Amenity 5.28 There are no residential properties in close proximity to the site that need to be taken into consideration by the proposed development.

Text: Landscape and Trees Landscape and Trees

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.29 Policy R3, Green Infrastructure, requires new development to mitigate the effects of climate change and support biodiversity by, for example, including green roofs, walls and tree planting. This is promoted to contribute to the diversification of the local economic and improving health and wellbeing. This Core Strategy Policy is reflected in the Neighbourhood Plan, with Policy G, Green Infrastructure, which also encourages opportunities to enhance all aspects of the public realm.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.30 In response to these policies, the inclusion of a green wall was proposed within the draft design. This was considered inappropriate within the Conservation Area setting and therefore this element of the proposal has been removed from the submitted plans.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.31 To replace this and ensure the proposed development positively responds to Policy R3, the proposal now incorporates a courtyard within which both hard and soft landscaping is proposed, including some tree planting. This is illustrated on the submitted landscaping plans.

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.32 There are no trees or existing landscaping within the site as defined by the redline location plan. There are some small immature trees on Central Way but these are either side of the site’s frontage to Central Way and will not be affected by the proposed development.

Text: Landscape and Trees 29

Text: Landscape and Trees 5.33 Considering the current position and the proposed landscaping works within the courtyard the development will increase landscaping to the benefit of biodiversity in accordance with Policy R3.

Text: Archaeology Archaeology

Text: Archaeology 5.34 Core Strategy Policy R1, Historic Environment, requires new development to consider any archaeological impacts, identify the presence or remains of any archaeological significance and manage any finds.

Text: Archaeology 5.35 In response to this policy requirement, an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment is submitted with the application. It concludes that due to the impact of previous development on and around the application site, the potential for significant archaeological remains is low. No mitigation is likely to be required.

Text: Archaeology 5.36 On this basis, the proposed development meets the requirements of Paragraph 194 of the NPPF and Policy R1 of the Local Plan.

Text: Access and Highways Access and Highways

Text: Access and Highways 5.37 Strategic Objection S06, Reduce the Need to Travel, promotes sustainable transport, and this is further supported by CS Policy L4, Sustainable Transport and Accessibility and Saved Policy T10, Transport and Land Use in Town Centres. These policies are also informed by guidance within the SPD3, Parking Standards and Design.

Text: Access and Highways 5.38 Section 9 of the NPPF, Promoting Sustainable Transport, requires development proposals to consider any impacts on transport networks at an early stage, promote walking, cycling and public transport, work with patterns of movement, including existing street layout.

Text: Access and Highways 5.39 Access will remain as existing, with pedestrian access to the George Street elevation, and vehicular access possible from Central Way. The ginnel will be retained, and the design incorporates an active frontage to this pedestrian link.

Text: Access and Highways 5.40 The proposed development is within a highly sustainable location within the defined Principal Town Centre. A Framework Travel Plan prepared by Egg Transport is submitted with the application. This promotes the use of alternative methods of transport over the private car.

Text: Access and Highways 5.41 Preapplication feedback confirmed that the proposed development would not need to provide any car parking provision due to its highly sustainable location. The proposal will include policy compliant cycle parking, 18 hoops are provided within a secure area of the central courtyard.

Text: Access and Highways 30

Text: Noise Noise

Text: Noise 5.42 Policy CS Policy L7 (Design) and Section 12 of the NPPF require new development to be designed to consider the amenity of other users. This includes the potential for the proposal to create any issues with noise.

Text: Noise 5.43 The application is accompanied by a Noise Impact Assessment prepared by Hepworth Acoustics. Based on the assessment’s review of the prevailing conditions, the report identifies a series of recommendations that are fully detailed within the report. These seek to control any noise through control of noise levels, such as avoiding the use of external loudspeakers. Recommendations are also provided in relation to controlling the noise level associated with fixed plant or equipment. Where details of this is not yet known, an acceptable level can be a conditioned.

Text: Noise 5.44 The Assessment notes that there would be no impact from noise break from the premises or the terrace area. The mitigation provides best practicable control of potential noise.

Text: Noise 5.45 With the mitigation in place, the Assessment concludes that the proposed development would not result in any unacceptable harm to residential amenity or noise disturbance.

Text: Ecology Ecology

Text: Ecology 5.46 Policy R2, Natural Environment, requires new development to protect and enhance the landscape character, biodiversity and geodiversity of the Borough. This includes street trees.

Text: Ecology 5.47 The existing site offers little in terms of ecological value. There are currently no trees within the application site, nor is there any green space.

Text: Ecology 5.48 The existing buildings have been assessed as part of a Bat Scoping Study prepared by Kingdom Ecology to assess whether they provide any potential for bat habitat.

Text: Ecology 5.49 The report confirms a lack of suitable habitat within the context of the site, with an absence of trees and vegetation for foraging and brightly lit areas. No evidence of bats was found within the existing buildings, and no roosting features noted. Within this urban context, and due to the character of the buildings themselves, the buildings only offer a negligible bat roost potential. The report also notes that there was no evidence of current or historic nesting bird activity.

Text: Ecology 5.50 No further survey effort or mitigation is proposed. Measures to enhance the site are recommended. These include the provision of swift and sparrow boxes to be incorporated within the design, and small/medium sized nectar rich tree planting.

Text: Ecology 31

Text: Drainage Drainage

Text: Drainage 5.51 Policy L5, Climate Change requires new development to improve water efficiency and reduce surface water run off through Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs).

Text: Drainage 5.52 A Drainage Strategy prepared by Brennan Consult is submitted with the planning application. It confirms that this site is currently served by a private combined water drain along the northern boundary adjacent to the Bricklayers Arms.

Text: Drainage 5.53 The Strategy also assesses the site in terms of its suitability for SUDs, noting which methods could be implemented as part of the proposed development. Geo-cellular Storage is identified as being suitable, with attenuation being introduced beneath the new building. Surface water will pass into the centre of the development, through a flow restricting device. The existing connection to the combined sewer will continue to be utilised, but this will be at restricted rates, which provides betterment over the existing situation.

Text: Drainage 5.54 This will provide betterment in terms of slowing the brownfield surface water runoff, responding to the requirements of Policy L5, Climate Change, and Section 14 of the NPPF.

Text: Planning Benefits Planning Benefits

Text: Planning Benefits 5.55

Text: Planning Benefits 06

Text: Planning Benefits 33

Text: Planning Benefits 6.1. The proposed development incorporates key planning benefits that positively respond to key objectives identified within the Development Plan:

Text: Planning Benefits • Delivery of a modern, high-quality Grade A office development which will help meet the need for this type of accommodation within the heart of Altrincham Town Centre. This will address key occupier requirements for linear configured floorplates, incorporating an enhanced specification and design commensurate with evolving tenant requirements.

Text: Planning Benefits • The high specification office space will be alongside new premises for mixed uses within the lower floors to provide active retail and/or leisure uses to respond to the central location of the site.

Text: Planning Benefits • The design will maximise the use of an underutilised site within Altrincham Town Centre that has been a long-term blight on the amenity of the area.

Text: Planning Benefits • Significantly improved pedestrian experience along Central Way, incorporating enhanced levels of activity, passive surveillance and interaction through an improved facade and high-quality public realm.

Text: Planning Benefits • Opportunities for the retention and improvement of the pedestrian connection between George Street and Central Way by providing high quality improvements to safety and security.

Text: Planning Benefits • Improved relationship with adjacent Everyman Theatre entrance.

Text: Planning Benefits • Increased activity levels within the Town Centre throughout the week with linked benefits for additional spend within local shops and restaurants.

Text: Planning Benefits • Direct employment benefits associated with the proposed office floorspace which will create in the region of 65 FTE jobs.

Text: Planning Benefits • A further indirect financial injection in to the local and regional economy through the construction supply chain. For every £1 spent on construction, demand of £2-£2.81 is generated overall supporting further jobs. Construction has one of the highest economic multipliers, reinforcing the wider regeneration benefits.

Text: Planning Benefits • Based upon benchmark values from similar uses in the immediate area annual business rates contribution in the order of £57,000 per annum. GVA benefit of approximately £3.5m per annum to the Trafford economy. Based upon the current estimated construction cost, approximately 30 construction- related workers could be supported during the development period.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion 07

Text: Conclusion 35

Text: Conclusion 7.1 This Planning Statement provides a description of the proposed development, sets this within the wider policy context, and assesses the proposals against key policy criteria. This demonstrates how the design has responded to policy requirements and preapplication feedback.

Text: Conclusion 7.2 The key planning considerations relate to the principle of the proposed mixed-use building within the Principal Town Centre, and the impact of the development on designated heritage assets. The design and inclusion of positive frontages to promote mixed uses to the ground floor at both George Street and Central Way support the high-grade office space proposed to upper floors, which all are wholly appropriate town centre uses. Further, the submitted Heritage Statement concludes that the design of the proposed development would result in no harm to either the George Street or Old Market Place Conservation Areas.

Text: Conclusion 7.3 The Statement also assesses the design with reference to the Design and Access Statement, noting the references to the Bricklayers Arms adjacent to the site, which is a non-designated heritage asset.

Text: Conclusion 7.4 All other policy considerations relating to trees, ecology, drainage and access are met. For the reasons set out within this statement, it is concluded that the proposed development meets the requirements of the Development Plan and responds to the detail relevant to material considerations. As such, we respectfully request planning permission be granted.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) The Framework (2021) and sets out the Government’s national planning policies for England and how these should be applied. At the core of the Framework is the presumption in favour of sustainable development. The NPPF requires (at paragraph 11) that applications which accord with the development plan be approved without delay. Building a strong, competitive economy Paragraphs 81 - 83 set out the government’s commitment to securing economic growth in order to create jobs and prosperity, placing significant weight on the need to support economic growth through the planning system.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 82 states that planning policies should set out a clear economic vision and strategy which positively and proactively encourages sustainable economic growth and be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, allow for new and flexible working practices and to enable a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances. Ensuring the vitality of town centres

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 86 - 91 seek to promote a positive approach to the growth, management and adaptation of town centres. Local planning authorities are advised to define a network and hierarchy of town centres and promote their long-term vitality and viability – by allowing them to grow and diversify in a way that can respond to rapid changes in the retail and leisure industries, allows a suitable mix of uses and reflects their distinctive characters. Main town centre uses should be located in town centres first, with a sequential approach taken outside of this. The NPPF provides a definition for main town centre uses which includes office development. Promoting healthy and safe communities

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 92 - 93 aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which promote social interaction, for example strong town centres, improved pedestrian connections and active street frontages. Places should be accessible and safe with high quality public space encouraging activity. Promoting sustainable transport

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 104 - 108 encourage development to be focused in locations which are sustainable, limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of transport modes. The NPPF clarifies at paragraph 105, that when considering parking standards, LPA’s should take in to account the accessibility of the development and the availability of public transport. Making effective use of land

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraphs 119 - 121 promote an effective use of land and prioritises the use of previously-developed or ‘brownfield’ land. Local authorities should give substantial weight to the value of using suitable brownfield land and promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Achieving well-designed places, Chapter 12 of the NPPF, is important. The creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 46

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) The NPPF states that local Planning policies and decisions should aim to ensure that developments:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) a) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) b) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) c) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change (such as increased densities); d) establish or maintain a strong sense of place, using the arrangement of streets, spaces, building types and materials to create attractive, welcoming and distinctive places to live, work and visit;

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) e) optimise the potential of the site to accommodate and sustain an appropriate amount and mix of development (including green and other public space) and support local facilities and transport networks; and

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) f) create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users49; and where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the quality of life or community cohesion and resilience. (paragraph 130).

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 132 recognises the importance of early discussion between applicants and the local planning authority to inform the evolution of a proposed design.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 194 states that local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paragraph 197 states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification (paragraph 200). Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use (paragraph 202).
