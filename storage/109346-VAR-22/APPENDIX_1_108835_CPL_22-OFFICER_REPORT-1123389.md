Text: LEGAL CONTEXT LEGAL CONTEXT

Text: LEGAL CONTEXT The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 applies to all land in England other than land which is the subject of a special development order, and specifies various classes of development which may be undertaken without the express permission of the Local Planning Authority (LPA). Such development, referred to as ‘permitted development’, is deemed to have planning permission by the Order and therefore does not require an express grant of planning permission from the LPA.

Text: LEGAL CONTEXT The applicant has submitted an application for a Certificate of Lawful Development for the use of the application site as a massage centre on the basis that both this and the existing lawful use fall within Class E of the Use Classes Order.

Text: LEGAL CONTEXT Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 defines the meaning of development. Section 55(1) defines development as “the making of any material change in use of any buildings or other land”. Section 55 (2) (f) states that "in the case of buildings or other land which are used for a purpose of any class specified in an order made by the Secretary of State under this section, the use of the buildings or other land or, subject to the provisions of the order, of any part of the buildings or the other land, for any other purpose of the same class" shall not be taken for the purposes of the Act to involve development.

Text: LEGAL CONTEXT In assessing this application, the LPA is making a determination of law as to whether or not the proposed development would be lawful on the basis that there would be no material change of use, having regard to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020.

Text: LEGAL CONTEXT Issues such as the policies contained in the Council's Adopted Local Development Plan cannot be taken into consideration as the decision is based on fact and not on policy grounds.

Text: Assessment Assessment

Text: Assessment Having regard to the planning history listed above (in particular planning permission H/63231 for change of use to restaurant use, granted on 13th December 2005) and other evidence including images on Google Maps / Street View, the LPA considers the units’ established current use is as a restaurant, which falls within Class E of the Use Classes Order, as amended. With the exception of an hours of use condition, there are no conditions that specifically restrict the nature of the use other than as set out in the classes in the Use Classes Order.

Text: Assessment The applicant has submitted a covering letter with the application, stating that the proposed massage centre will offer various massage treatments to its customers to aid recovery from illness, relieve stress and aid relaxation, including deep tissue massage, sports massage, Swedish massage and maternity massage as well as hot stones, foot massage and scalp massage.

Text: Assessment Having regard to this statement, it is considered that this use would fall within Class E (e) – the provision of medical or health services, principally to visiting members of the public.

Text: Assessment Application reference 108835/CPL/22

Text: Assessment It is therefore concluded that the use of the premises for this purpose would not constitute a material change of use and would be lawful development, subject to compliance with the conditions attached to the original grant of planning permission for the restaurant use (H/63231) including Condition 2 which states that the premises shall not be open to customers outside the following hours: 1100 hours to midnight Mondays to Sundays.

Text: RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE LAWFUL DEVELOPMENT (PROPOSED) RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE LAWFUL DEVELOPMENT (PROPOSED)

Text: REASON FOR APPROVAL: REASON FOR APPROVAL:

Text: REASON FOR APPROVAL: The existing lawful restaurant use of Unit 3C, 5A and 5B, as shown on the submitted plan, drawing number 11509-001, Issue 1, received by the local planning authority 23 September 2022, and the proposed use of the same unit as a ‘massage centre’, in accordance with the details set out in the covering letter from White Peak Planning dated 3rd August 2022, both fall under Class E, Part A, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020. Therefore the proposed use of the unit as a massage centre, in accordance with the details set out in the covering letter from White Peak Planning dated 3rd August 2022, would not constitute a material change of use as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and would be lawful development, subject to compliance with Condition 2 attached to the original grant of planning permission for the restaurant use (H/63231), which states that the premises shall not be open to customers outside the following hours: 1100 hours to midnight Mondays to Sundays.
