Text: WA14 2RE This document is to be read in conjunction with the Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment prepared by Dickinson Waugh Conservation and dated February 2021 (the heritage statement).

Text: WA14 2RE This document has been prepared by the author of the heritage statement in response to a request by the local authority for additional information relating to conservation as required in order to determine the planning application, and follows a meeting on site with the Planning Officer Cormac McGowen and Conservation Officer Elisabeth Lewis on the 22nd April 2021.

Text: WA14 2RE Following the meeting, further amendments were made to the proposals, specifically:

Text: WA14 2RE Retention of gates to be fixed open;

Text: WA14 2RE • Widening of the access;

Text: WA14 2RE Rebuilding of historic chimney;

Text: WA14 2RE Refurbishment of existing windows; and,

Text: WA14 2RE Retention of the existing slate roof tiles.

Text: WA14 2RE These are shown on the current drawings prepared by Calder Peel.

Text: WA14 2RE The significance of the building and the contribution it makes to the distinctive character and appearance of the Conservation Area is clearly set out in the heritage statement.

Text: WA14 2RE The current proposals are considered to reverse previously harmful alterations which were carried out to the building.

Text: WA14 2RE The impact of the proposals on the architectural interest attributed to the building and its setting are clearly positive and the proposals serve to enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.

Text: WA14 2RE With regard to the request for a more substantial explanation for the demolition of the rear walls; this was necessary in order to facilitate the delivery of the wider proposals permitted under application ref: 95548/FUL/18.

Text: WA14 2RE The building is defined as a non-designated heritage asset due to the contribution it makes to the Conservation Area and this is primarily related to the façade, and to a lesser degree the flanking wall. The rear and internal walls and structure hold no appreciable heritage value.

Text: WA14 2RE Regardless, the heritage statement and existing floor plans confirm that there was very little left of the original structure due to previous invasive alterations that had been carried out to the building.

Text: WA14 2RE The applicant has worked to ensure the elements of historic interest and that contribute to the Conservation Area, including roof tiles, chimney stacks and the distinctive features on the principal elevation are stable and capable of sensitive and informed reinstatement and restoration.
