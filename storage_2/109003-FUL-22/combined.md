Text: Anti-Social Behaviour Management Plan Version 2 Anti-Social Behaviour Management Plan Version 2

Text: Beyond connection Beyond connection

Text: Beyond connection BT are working to reduce digital inequality and help make communities better connected. From the iconic red phone boxes to the modern glass units, we’ve always been at the forefront of technology that brings people closer.

Text: Beyond connection In today’s digitally enabled world many phone boxes are sitting unused, prime sites for anti-social behaviour and vandalism. Following the success of our InLink programme where we brought free digital services to high streets across the UK, we’re further transforming our legacy payphones into state-of-the- art, fibre-connected digital community hubs – called Street Hubs.

Text: Beyond connection Not only does this remove old payphones, freeing-up space and reducing anti-social behaviour, but each Street Hub gives entire communities access to an unprecedented suite of essential free services. This includes ultrafast Wi-Fi, phone calls, wayfinding, device charging, a dedicated 999 call button and public messaging capabilities. It’s also a platform for future technologies – air quality monitoring, emergency messaging, 4G / 5G mobile coverage and more.

Text: Beyond connection Since June 2017, hundreds of first generation Streets Hubs (formerly InLinks) have gone live in cities throughout the UK, connecting over a million unique devices to Wi-Fi every month, with tens of thousands of tablet sessions and free calls each week.

Text: Beyond connection Wherever a Street Hub is installed we work with local stakeholders like councils and the police to ensure they’re a positive contribution to the area. We’re committed to addressing the few users in limited locations who abuse this service.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Automatic anti-social call restriction

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction The advanced nature of Street Hubs and our investment in quality systems means we can quickly identify and solve issues.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Working with local stakeholders has already led to significant technical and process advances that further help each Street Hub contribute positively to the local area.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction A small number of locations drew attention to local drug issues, with those involved misusing free call services. Following this we invested significantly in developing call restriction capabilities. These were first used to prevent calls to mobiles on select Street Hubs in problem areas – identified with the help of police and council community safety teams.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction The automatic recognition of possible misuse and blocking of identified numbers is based on a proprietary algorithm and technical process developed in consultation with the police and councils from across the UK. These consider a range of factors, including but not limited to the frequency of attempted and connected calls, the length and distribution of such calls, and insights provided by relevant stakeholders.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Once numbers are identified, their call data is continuously assessed and our algorithm always applied. When a blocked number is flagged by the algorithm this restriction is permanent. In some cases, on request, we may restrict numbers over a set period.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction Should someone believe a number has been wrongly flagged, they can contact our team at streethub@bt.com who will consider the case, consulting with the police and local council where appropriate. This option will be shown on the Street Hub screen as part of the warning notification when a restricted number is dialled.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction This automatic anti-social call restriction technology is a dynamic feature of Street Hubs that can be adapted over time as further insights are gained or as patterns of misuse change.

Text: Automatic anti-social call restriction 2

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Identification of anti-social behaviour issues

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues We take our responsibility towards community wellbeing and anti-social behaviour seriously, as evidenced by our above investment. Where possible we address any concerns before (or as part of) the planning application process which every Street Hub must go through.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Unfortunately this is not always possible, and pre-existing or emerging concerns around misuse may need to be addressed once a Street Hub is active, if not picked up by the automatic anti-social call restriction technology.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues In deciding the best course of action, advice from police, other emergency services and local authorities will always take precedence, followed by feedback from other government bodies and input from residents and businesses.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues To best identify issues and how to address them, we need:

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues • a description of the issue and when it occurred(s)

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues the location of the Street Hub(s) involved and how they contributed.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues •

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Supporting evidence is also important, where legally possible, to help us understand the issue (i.e. data or images) so that the appropriate action can be considered.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Each Street Hub is remotely monitored for service compliance 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and physically inspected and cleaned at least every two weeks. As such, any issues are likely to be quickly reported to us directly.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Where a police officer, member of the public or council officer identifies a possible anti-social behaviour issue, we can be contacted in a number of ways to take appropriate action.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Sending an email to streethub@bt.com is the main method for reporting an anti-social behaviour issue associated with a Street Hub. This will automatically raise a ticket on our system, which is actively reviewed and managed by the Street Hubs team.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Emails sent from police.uk or .gov email addresses will be treated as priority.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Technical issues like display screen failures, graffiti, etc. should be reported to streethub@bt.com.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Should it not be possible or convenient to send an email, the Street Hubs helpline is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on 08003890917.

Text: Identification of anti-social behaviour issues Although we’re committed to working closely with communities to address concerns around anti- social behaviour, suspected criminal behaviour may need to be managed through official police channels by contacting 101 or 999 in an emergency.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of technical changes

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of After receiving a police crime risk assessment or report from a local authority suggesting a Street Hub may be contributing to crime or anti-social behaviour, we will assess the technical solutions available to minimise / reduce this.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of The location of each Street Hub means the way they are used and experienced varies, and so the solution will need to be bespoke.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of Where a temporary or interim technical change to a Street Hub may be considered, we work with the local council and police wherever possible to gather timely evidence and information so we understand what is happening and how best to respond. This could include:

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of reviewing the information provided from any previous tickets

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • visiting the location and meeting with local stakeholders

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of •

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of speaking with the local police and council to understand any reports they have received and what they are already doing to tackle similar issues in the area

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • collating relevant media reports, historic records, and similar

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of • assessing Street Hubs data such as anonymised call information, Wi-Fi usage, etc.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of Situations that follow a similar pattern may be handled more quickly based on recommendations from groups such as the police. For example, temporarily restricting the ability to call mobile numbers where it has been proven that a Street Hub is being misused to buy illegal drugs.

Text: Assessment and determining the suitability of 4

Text: Implementing available technical changes Implementing available technical changes

Text: Implementing available technical changes Street Hubs are actively monitored and adaptable, with a range of temporary and interim technical measures available to help manage anti-social behaviour issues. These were part of the original design or developed as part of our dedication to community wellbeing.

Text: Implementing available technical changes These include but are not limited to:

Text: Implementing available technical changes • using the displays to include warnings and relevant information

Text: Implementing available technical changes further reducing the Street Hub’s call speaker volume

Text: Implementing available technical changes • disabling the USB port to prevent loitering around the unit

Text: Implementing available technical changes • blocking calls to specific numbers (only when agreed with the police, in addition to those captured under automatic anti-social call restriction).

Text: Implementing available technical changes We prefer to make changes in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to minimise any unintended social impact. For example, a local council or police command providing additional street teams in the area.

Text: Implementing available technical changes Our anti-social behaviour portal has advanced since the roll-out of InLink. As well as our algorithm, the portal now lets us block suspicious behaviour in real time so we can tackle any anti-social behaviour request without delay. We also have greater insight into reporting and numbers where thresholds are exceeded. These technical advances help reduce crime and allow us to work better with the police and community.

Text: Sign off and implementation Any change made to how a Street Hub is configured at a hardware or software level will require our agreement.

Text: Sign off and implementation As an OFCOM-designated Universal Service Provider of public call boxes for the provision of a publicly available telephone service, any decision to restrict provision of phone calls will need to be made exclusively by us. This will be based in part on detail provided by the police and local authority, and pay due regard to the evidence presented.

Text: Sign off and implementation We would always seek to balance any requirement to restrict Street Hub services to manage anti-social behaviour with the desire to make them available to all, as part of our work to help make communities better connected and reduce digital inequality.

Text: Sign off and implementation 5

Text: Review process Review process

Text: Review process Our approach to addressing anti-social behaviour associated with a Street Hub is to be collaborative. The success of any intervention relies on the police and / or councils taking reasonable steps to help address the underlying issues and the review process being tailored to each local situation.

Text: Review process In the small number of cases where the need for an operational change (such as restricting phone calls) has been identified, it will be considered temporary and applied for a limited period (typically three months but up to twelve months in high-risk locations). This temporary period allows police and the local council to investigate and take appropriate action.

Text: Street Hub Noise Management Plan Version 2 Street Hub Noise Management Plan Version 2

Text: Background Background

Text: Background As one of many features, Street Hubs provide free phone calls via a speaker and microphone system. The following document identifies the steps we are able take to ensure that these calls, like all the features of the Street Hub, help improve the amenity of a local area whilst also respecting the expectations of local community over time. Please note: this noise management plan refers specifically to the noise from the Street Hub. Noise from pedestrians, users of the Street Hub, or from other nearby sources are not included and would typically be considered matters for the Police and other authorities who have the appropriate and relevant powers to act on such issues if necessary.

Text: Background We have designed our Street Hub so that they create a ‘sound cloud’ for the person making a call with noise levels sufficient to make calls with background noise for the surroundings. Whilst this generates a reasonable conversational volume in proximity to the Street Hub, it is intended to result in minimal to no noise being noticeable further away. The average volume settings are 65dB average at 3m distance from each Street Hub. Users may also choose to use headphones when making calls or using the tablet, which deactivates the speaker for the duration of their use.

Text: Background It is worth noting that the Street Hub are situated on public streets, in the most part close to roads where high volumes of traffic will be seen, examples of background noise experienced on streets are details below:

Text: Background Noise Level, dB Example 60-70 Conversational Speech 70-80 Average traffic on Street Corner 80-90 Heavy lorries at 6m

Text: Noise Management Plan Noise Management Plan

Text: Daytime (07:00 – 21:00) Daytime (07:00 – 21:00)

Text: Daytime (07:00 – 21:00) Street Hub have controllable volume levels. This will default to 50% at the start of any user activity during the day and can be increased and decreased based on the preferences of the user.

Text: Night Time (21:00 – 07:00) Night Time (21:00 – 07:00)

Text: Night Time (21:00 – 07:00) Between the hours of 21:00 to 07:00 all Street Hub will be governed so that the volume cannot be increased to greater than 60% of the maximum volume.

Text: 999 Calls 999 Calls

Text: 999 Calls It should be noted that when the 999 is called through the tablet or the emergency button is pressed by a user the volume of calls is set to 100% to ensure that any user is able to effectively communicate with the emergency services. This volume can be lowered as requested by the user.

Text: 999 Calls 2

Text: Exceptional Circumstances Exceptional Circumstances

Text: Exceptional Circumstances We manage noise by exception based on feedback from users and the local community. If we receive any feedback that the Street Hub may be causing detrimental environmental impact, we take the following actions:

Text: Exceptional Circumstances 1. Understand the reason for the issue and any extenuating circumstances. At this point we will separate out any Police or community safety matters and work directly with the relevant authorities, and support the local residents in raising these issues through official channels where appropriate.

Text: Exceptional Circumstances 2. We will then verify the evidence provided against the Street Hub’s call history and other operational data as required. This will allow us to understand the number, time, and frequency of outbound calls being made and better understand the severity of the reported situation.

Text: Exceptional Circumstances 3. Once we have verified the situation, we will typically look to apply local bespoke volume governor controls appropriate to the situation. We have found that reducing the Street Hub ’s maximum volume to 40% during relevant periods tends to resolve issues where they have been identified.

Text: Exceptional Circumstances 4. We will continue to monitor the situation and listen to ongoing feedback from the community as we do take matters seriously. We continue to learn as part of our roll out how Street Hub are fitting in to the community.

Text: Noise Testing Noise Testing

Text: Noise Testing We have conducted 2 separate tests on the Street Hub, the initial test are to simulate typical operating temperatures (Test Scenario 1), with the secondary test simulating the worst case operating temperature (fans setting at max speed; Test Scenario 2). Each test involved 16 different test points taking part at 1.5m above floor level, with 3 readings being taken at each location, resulting in over 48 readings per test condition (96 in total). The equipment used to conduct the tests was the ANENG-GN101 Decibel Monitor. The average results in test scenario 1 was 50.5dB (55.9dB without factoring in background noise), in test scenario 2 the average result was 59.1dB (60.4dB without factoring in background noise).

Text: Our approach Our approach

Text: Our approach Our approach to planning is to be collaborative with councils wherever possible, working closely with relevant stakeholders to identify suitable sites for Street Hubs and to select which payphones are to be removed.

Text: Our approach Once the appropriate permissions have been gained we progress with removals and installations with the minimal possible disruption to residents and businesses.

Text: Our approach Activation is as automated as possible to minimise the time our engineers spend setting-up and checking the units are ready for service.

Text: Our approach We welcome the opportunity to collaborate on all stages of the rollout in an area wherever possible.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications Street Hub design and specifications

Text: Street Hub design and specifications Street Hubs are free-standing structures featuring a fully accessible tablet interface and digital HD display screens on two sides. Overall Street Hub dimensions are 35cm deep and 123.6cm wide (reduced tapered footprint is 120.1cm), with a height of 298cm to maximise the Wi-Fi range without dominating the street. A narrow base limits the footprint while ensuring access to wheelchair users.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications The screens display content at 10-second intervals, both the commercial content that funds the service as well as a wide range of local community and council content.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications The two screens automatically dim at night to 600cd/m2, following daylight hours and in accordance with the levels set for this type and size of screen (those under 10m) by the Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05 2015:

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Our Wi-Fi in detail

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Street Hubs connect their communities to the fastest and most robust free public Wi-Fi service in the UK, 1Gbps within 150m. Full fibre connectivity enables speeds up to 13.91 times faster than standard fixed line home broadband and can handle large numbers of connected users without any reduction in speed.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail An omnidirectional outdoor Wi-Fi access point at the top of each Street Hub is connected directly to the fibre broadband network, with co-channel interference mitigated by directing Wi-Fi signals away from neighbouring access points. Our full fibre solution allows capacity upgrades by orders of magnitude (e.g. 1Gbps to 10Gbps) without street works.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Signing up is simple – a one-time email address registration allows automatic connection whenever a user is in range of an active Street Hub. Our customer-first policy means we don’t sell email addresses on, and have no pop-up adverts when users reconnect. Content filtering also prohibits access to adults-only websites.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Where a ‘superconnected cities’ public Wi-Fi service is already provided to the council by BT, this signal can also be broadcast from all Street Hubs in that city at no additional charge.

Text: Interactive tablet Interactive tablet

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Combating anti-social behaviour

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Street Hubs are operated in accordance with the Street Hub Anti-Social Behaviour Management Plan that was developed with assistance from the police and a number of local authorities.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour where a Street Hub has been misused to buy illegal drugs. Subject to internal processes, the police can ‘whitelist’ a specific number where there is an operational need, i.e. involved in an active investigation.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Automatic anti-social call blocking technology uses anonymised data to identify suspicious call patterns and phone numbers. Identified numbers are blocked on Street Hubs across the UK, while still allowing genuine users to benefit from the free phone call service.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour People can contact StreetHub@bt.com to report technical issues, antisocial behaviour involving a Street Hub, or to claim their number has been flagged in error. Their case will be considered in

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Depending on circumstances, other measures can be taken including further reducing call volumes, restricting calls at certain times, or only allowing headset calls.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour consultation with the police and local council where appropriate. This option will be highlighted on the screen when a call is attempted to a restricted number. Emails sent from police.uk or .gov email addresses will be treated as a priority.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Recommendations from groups like the police may mean quicker implementation of measures, for example temporarily restricting mobile calls

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Should it not be possible or convenient to send an email, it’s possible to call the Street Hub helpline on 0800661610 (open 24 hours 7 days).

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour As BT is designated by OFCOM as a Universal Service Provider of public call boxes, any decision to restrict phone service will need to be made exclusively by BT. Decisions to change any service will be based on details provided by police and local authorities:

Text: Air quality monitoring Across the UK, we’re trialling air quality monitoring equipment within Street Hubs. The information from these sensors could be used by participating (and interested) councils and researchers to complement other data sources and improve local decision making.

Text: Air quality monitoring Councils adopting Street Hub are invited to express interest in being involved in this trial. Feedback from participants will guide how the data is communicated and used.

Text: Air quality monitoring Initially, we’re looking at the potential measurement of the following elements of air pollution:

Text: Air quality monitoring • Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Nitric Oxide (NO).

Text: Air quality monitoring Further work is being undertaken on the possible measurement of:

Text: Air quality monitoring • Ground Ozone Level (O3)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Particles (PM2.5)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Particles (PM10)

Text: Air quality monitoring Sulphur Dioxide (SO2).

Text: Air quality monitoring Measurement for each of the above are being assessed on their individual merits, and a decision of which to include in a given Street Hub and when has not yet been made.

Text: Air quality monitoring “We are excited to be working with BT to equip their street furniture with our innovative technology to monitor and reduce carbon emissions. This will help local authorities monitor their carbon footprint in real-time, identify the best opportunities to cut emissions, and access new funding for the necessary investments. At scale, the UK could become the first nation to continuously monitor carbon emissions over its entire territory. This would boost its goal of net zero by 2050.”

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit Street Hubs collect and display useful, real-time data and insights from communities to help government officials and local decision makers get more from the space around them.

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit As with the air quality trial highlighted above, the modular nature of Street Hubs lets us improve, evaluate and invest in tools and techniques to collect meaningful insights, i.e.:

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit • Counting pedestrian numbers

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit Bike and vehicle counting

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit • Measuring traffic congestion

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit Environmental factors like sound and light.

Text: Additional smart city sensors and data collection for community benefit Continued investment allows ‘smart cities’ to improve public well-being and health with data. This kind of data is most powerful when shared, so we would look to make these insights available to communities as permitted by law and within our Privacy Notice and Terms of Use.

Text: Installing a Street Hub Installing a Street Hub

Text: Installing a Street Hub Several steps are involved in the installation of a Street Hub once approval is obtained from the relevant local authority:

Text: 1. Preparation works 1. Preparation works

Text: 5. Connecting services 5. Connecting services

Text: 5. Connecting services Before work starts each site is surveyed to identify services and other underground infrastructure (e.g. water or gas pipes) so our teams do not disrupt services.

Text: 2. Safety comes first 2. Safety comes first

Text: 2. Safety comes first Our deployment teams will set up barriers to restrict access to the work area. These are based on permits obtained from the local authority.

Text: 2. Safety comes first Power is connected by the Distribution Network Operator (DNO). Fibre is connected by Openreach. Both may need ducting run from nearby infrastructure, such as broadband cabinets. The teams responsible for this work will typically receive work permits from the local authority in accordance with an area identified at survey.

Text: Payphone removals Payphone removals

Text: Payphone removals Street Hubs are often installed on the same location as an existing BT payphone so the first works you may see are teams disconnecting and removing existing kiosks.

Text: Lifting the Street Hub into place Lifting the Street Hub into place

Text: Lifting the Street Hub into place Each Street Hub is typically lifted by small crane from a flatbed truck onto the metal baseplate about 1-3 days after the building of the foundation. At this time any remaining barriers are removed.

Text: 4. Preparation of foundations 4. Preparation of foundations

Text: 4. Preparation of foundations Each Street Hub sits on a metal base plate, part of a concrete foundation, 30-40cm below ground level with ducting to allow connection to fibre and power. It’s designed to easily withstand being pushed by individuals or high winds, and fall slowly if struck by a vehicle – with internal sensors notifying us of the event.

Text: Management, maintenance, and operational strategy Management, maintenance, and operational strategy

Text: Management, maintenance, and operational strategy BT is responsible for the management of Street Hub services with each unit physically inspected weekly across the estate.

Text: Inspection regimes Inspection regimes

Text: Inspection regimes The Street Hubs are visited every two weeks for cleaning, by hand and with pressure washers. The materials used make this process easy with defined materials and processes. Whilst cleaners are on site, they check for damage and ensure the tablets and screens are working.

Text: Inspection regimes In addition, our in-field quality inspection teams visit at least every two weeks on an alternative schedule to our cleaning team, performing several checks including (but not limited to):

Text: Inspection regimes Full walk-around with supporting photos to check for damage, graffiti and black screens

Text: Inspection regimes Functionality checks on the tablet to test calls, maps, 999 and USB charging.

Text: Inspection regimes We can also send out emergency visits if reported as necessary by internal sensors.

Text: Monitoring and repair management Monitoring and repair management

Text: Monitoring and repair management Street Hubs are monitored remotely 24/7, our primary mechanism to spot faults with the above local inspections ensuring the effectiveness of this monitoring.

Text: Monitoring and repair management Once identified, we have processes to resolve issues within agreed service levels. Most will be resolved within three working days, with safety and power issues having a more rapid resolution target than cosmetic issues like graffiti.

Text: Future upgrades Future upgrades

Text: Future upgrades We plan to make changes as needed to address identified faults or to improve services. Whilst some may involve physical attendance at the unit, the majority will be done remotely via software upgrades. All updates are rigorously quality assured before release.

Text: Appendices Appendices

Text: Heritage Assets • George Street Conservation Area

Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment This Heritage Statement is submitted to support applications for Full Planning and Advertisement Consent on behalf of BT as part of the upgrade of their existing kiosk estate in Trafford. It should be read in conjunction with the Planning, Design and Access Statement submitted to the LPA.

Text: Impact Assessment In submitting these applications specific regard has been had to the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, (the Act) published Government guidance and the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Network Development. Special regard has also been given to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character, appearance and setting of nearby Conservation Areas and any other relevant historical assets in accordance with the Act. The adopted polices of the Trafford Local Plan have also been adhered to, SO8 - Protect the historic built environment.

Text: Impact Assessment The application site is located along a well-lit stretch of pavement on George Street, which is a busy public highway for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The area is predominantly made up of retail outlets at ground level including Holland & Barrett

Text: Impact Assessment TRA004-Planning-HeritageStatement

Text: Impact Assessment directly adjacent to the site. There is an array of established street furniture along this section of pavement including signposts, benches and bollards. It is also noted that other types of advertisements and fascia signs have been accepted in the vicinity, some of which are illuminated. These are located primarily at the ground level of nearby shops.

Text: Impact Assessment Whilst these modern, commercial surroundings are seen as an entirely appropriate location for a BT Street Hub unit, it is noted that the site is found within the George Street Conservation Area. Whilst the important scenic, historic and architectural features of this building and wider area are noted, it is argued that the primary setting of the application site outside Holland & Barret is one that is dominated by modern shop frontages and illuminated advertisements with fascial signage.

Text: Impact Assessment It needs to be reiterated that the development in question is for the upgrade of existing pieces of street furniture found. Given these telephone booths with their incorporated advertisements have already been accepted as part of this historical environment, the proposed BT Street Hub development will be able to effectively assimilate into a busy street scene where the precedent for modern communication infrastructure has already been set. As such due to the scale of development and wider setting of the locality, any impact by the proposal on the Conservation Areas is expected to be minimal.

Text: Impact Assessment Furthermore, it is considered that any minor to negligible harm that could be caused would be significantly outweighed by the removal of the two existing BT kiosks and the myriad of public benefits the Street Hub will bring to residents, businesses and tourists in this part of Altrincham. It is also believed that the decluttering of George Street pavement and upgrade of old street furniture will be to the betterment of the local Conservation areas and help to enhance the character of the area.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion It is widely recognised that street scenes up and down the country are constantly evolving, in which accommodating modern communication infrastructure is an essential part of this change. The proposed Street Hub is a slender, well-designed structure with

Text: Conclusion TRA004-Planning-HeritageStatement

Text: Conclusion advanced technology and public benefits that no other similar proposal can match. In this instance, when balanced against all material factors, the applicants conclude that the combination of the siting, design and public benefits provided will make the immediate area of Altrincham a more welcoming and accessible place to be, whilst at the same preserving the setting and significance of the Conservation Areas.

The document reports on current knowledge and experience within the specific fields of light and lighting described and is intended to be used by the ILP membership and other interested parties. It should be noted, however, that the status of this document is advisory and not mandatory. The ILP should be consulted regarding possible subsequent amendments. Any mention of organisations or products does not imply endorsement by the ILP. Whilst every care has been taken in th e compilation of any lists, up to th e time of going to press, these may not be comprehensive. Compliance with any recommendations does not itself confer immunity from legal obligations .

Text: Introduction 1 This document is intended to provide pragmatic quldance to all people involved with exterior illuminated advertisements. This document supersedes TR05: Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements published in 2001 and has been updated to reflect changes in lighting practice, technology and legal framework.

Text: Introduction 1 The scope of the guide is to cover installations of advertisements within the British Isles, however, the planning regulations vary from country to country and whilst the key requirements are given in Section 3.1 it is not possible in a document like this report to exhaustively cover every law applying to advertisements and signs in each in many sections of this guide the processes follow a template country. Moreover, derived from English planning regulations.

Text: Introduction 1 Illuminated signage and advertisements have become an integral part of our street scene and they are designed to have an impact. The aim of this document is to provide guidance on how to assess the impact of any additional signage. When considering any application for additional signage, thought should be given to how it is to be viewed within the street scene. One sign on its own may have a minimal impact on the street scene however many signs may have a negative impact on the street scene confusing the visual task or visual amenity.

Text: England The Town and Country Planning Act 1990' provides powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations 'restricting or regulating the display of advertisements so far as appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient in the interests of amenity or public safety'. This power is under sections 220-224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 .

Text: England The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 20072 have been in force since 6 April 2007. These Regulations revoked and rep laced the earlier versions issued in the 1990s. Section 336(i) of the T&P Act 1990 (as amended by section 24 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991') provides a comprehe nsive definition of the te rm advertisement (see above) of which there are 3 types. Firstly th ere are many advertisements which are outside any control. The Regulations automatically support a second group of advertisements as 'deemed consent' under Part 2. These advertisements do not requ ire the LPA's consent . This is subject to a compliance with specified 'Conditions and Limitations' which are explored below and include some illuminated signs. Thirdly where such advertisements

However, th ere are some common themes which control the illumination of advertisements under Classes 2B, 2C, 4A, 4B and 8. These include th e need to comply with 'd eemed consent' and therefore such advertisements do not require 'express consent'. The advertisements should comply with th e following features:

Text: England Areas of Special Control (ASC)

Text: England These restrict the type of advertisement which can be insta lled over the normal 'deemed consent' criteria. The 200 7 Regulations and those applicable to Wales and Scotland enable designa tion by a LPA with subsequent approval by the Secretary of State. These can be revoked or modified and require review every 5 years. Often ASC are in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or National Parks.

Text: England The 2007 Regulations preclude the installing of Classes 4A, 4B, 8, 13 and 14 and therefore illuminated advertisements without 'express consent'. This gives the LPA opportunities to consider whether it is appropriate to give consent to such advertisements in the interests of amenity and public safety. Due to the sensitive special requirements associated with ASC there may be robust amenity reasons why such illuminated signage should be restricted. In Scotland there is no opportunity to display such signs whatsoever.

Text: Brightness and luminance Brightness and luminance

Text: Brightness and luminance The fundamental relationship on which the recommendations contained within this report are based, is that between luminance and brightness.

Text: Brightness and luminance Luminance is a characteristic of the sign, dependent on the position of the observer, but independent of th e surrounding conditions. Generally a sign face is non uniform and the luminance will vary across it. The luminance will also vary with the direction of viewing, being a maximum for direct frontal observation. The highly diffusing plastic materials normally used in signs result in the luminance remaining near the maximum over a fairly wide range of viewing angles, falling off steeply for very oblique viewing.

Text: Brightness and luminance Brightness is the visual sensation associated with luminance, experienced by an observer. It depends on four main factors:

Text: Brightness and luminance a) luminance

Text: Brightness and luminance b) size

Text: Brightness and luminance c) contrast

Text: Brightness and luminance d) the observer

Text: Brightness and luminance In addition, other factors, which may affect brightness, are the position of the sign with respect to the observer's field of view, particularly when it appears on the periphery; the effect of phototropism, and the uniformity of luminance across the sign face.

Text: Brightness and luminance The difficulties associated with the problem of sign luminance may be appreciated by considering two identical signs in different settings. If one is placed in a well lit shopping area it will appear to be considerably less bright than its counterpart in a dark country lane. The one may be attractive and th e other offensive, although the signs themselves are identical. The luminance is the same for both signs but the

Text: Brightness and luminance 16

Text: Brightness and luminance Institution of Lighting Professionals

Text: Brightness and luminance contrast between the sign and its surroundings and therefore the brightness is quite different.

Text: Brightness and luminance The LPA is concerned primarily with brightness, whilst the manufacturer is able to control lum inance only. It is possible to set upper limits of luminance for defined types of location and graded size of sign, such that compliance with them will minimise the number of illuminated advertisements that are subjectively too bright yet will permit them to be adequately bright for their purpose.

Text: Brightness and luminance During the preparation of this report many observations and measurements have been taken of illuminated advertisements in a variety of locations including Central London, provinclal cities, suburban areas, mixed residential and shopping areas, retail parks, pedestrian precincts and areas of special historical and architectural interest. The measured luminance has been related to acceptable degrees of subjective brightness for many sizes of illuminated advertisements in Widely different environments.

Text: Brightness and luminance The measurements taken on signs and fascias cover maximum luminance and average luminance. There is always some variation of luminance over a sign and the average, even after several measurements have been made, can only be estimated approxlrnatelv. Therefore the recommendations within this report deal with limits on the maximum luminance of a sign . This has the advantage that:

Text: Brightness and luminance a) Where, as often happens, the brightest area can be selected by eye, only one measurement is required and the maximum is a definite figure.

Text: Brightness and luminance Signs with large variations of brightness are more likely to infringe b) limits imposed upon the maximum luminance than upon the average.

Text: Brightness and luminance The uniformity of luminance across a defined illuminated area must be kept within reasonable limits so as to ensure a pleasing and effective result (see section 8). It may be of help to designers and manufacturers of signs to consider the luminance gradient of illuminated advertisement signs . A method for testing both luminance and luminance gradient is

Text: Brightness and luminance described in Section 9.

Text: Brightness and luminance In setting upper limits for the luminance of signs it is important to take account of the considerable reduction in brightness which may occur during the life of the installati on. The overriding consideration must be that it should not present a hazard when the lighting is

Text: Brightness and luminance Internally illuminated sign with good uniformity

Text: Brightness and luminance :

Text: Brightness and luminance Institution of Lighting Professionals

Text: Brightness and luminance 17

Text: Brightness and luminance commissioned. In practice, design calculations would normally be set at a datum point of 100 hours after the initial light source lumen output, and therefore measurements should not be taken before the light sources have been in commission for 100 hours. In practice, it is considered that installations are likely to have a luminance between 50% and 80% of the initial value for a major part of their life, depending on maintenance.

Text: Brightness and luminance Large format media screens pose additional problems when trying to assess brightness, this is because the luminance of the sign varies with both time and position on the sign. For this reason it is recommended that the sign be set to a full output white when it is being measured to ensure that the maximum luminance of the sign is measured.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements Consideration should be made to introducing a system of control that imposes a limit on the maximum luminance and time of operation of an advertisement. Any system of control must be easy to und erstand, interpret, apply and enforce within the present Regulations. It is essential that any luminance limits specified should have regard to amenity and public safety. At the same ti me, account must be ta ken of the amenities to which good illuminated advertisement installations contribute and of th e commercial interests involved.

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements The ILP has produced Guidance Notes for the Reduction of Light Pollution and the general principles contained therein are worthy of consideration for all lighting installations. In particular the Guidance Notes detail a number of ways which may be used to reduce the problems of unnecessary, obtrusive light:

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements a) Switch off illumination when not required - one possible solution is a curfew with further limitations on lighting levels between agreed hours (e.g. off between 23.00hr and dawn).

Text: Limiting the luminance of illuminated advertisements b) For signs with external illumination direct light downwards whenever possible. If there is no alternative to up-lighting , then the use of shields and baffles to help reduce light spill.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The maximum recommend ed levels of luminance contai ned within this report are intended to be used in order to satisfy the requ irements of all parties and on the basis of sound engineering judgement and amenity considerations. It may be necessary to include other areas within particular zones, such as areas of particular architectural interest within zone El, so as to ensure th at and historical th e illuminati on of advertisements is in keeping not only with its purpose, but also with the environment. Such an example would be a Dark Landscape Park within an otherwise Zone E3 or E4 location.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The checking of luminance levels to ensure compliance with th e Advertisement Consent, or for the purposes of measurements in those cases when dispute or doubt arises, requires the use of a suitable reliable instrument capable of direct measurement. It is possible that the local authority's lighti ng engin eer will already possess a suitable instrument, but if this is not th e case it is recommended that one should be acquired for the express purpose of obtaining luminance measurements of illuminated advertisements. It is recommended that any luminance meter used should comp ly with the requirements for a Type F meter as defined by as 7920:2005 Luminance meters. Requirements and test methods.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Whenever a performance measurement is carried out there are a number of factors that may impact upon the performance of the lighting installation being tested. There are a number of issues associated with the lighting equipment and others that relate to the environment.

Text: 9 Testing and verification It is important to ensure that the output of the lamps is stable. In general this requires that they have been run for at least 100 hours and they have had time to run up a reach thermal stability, which may take half an hour or so. Also if the lamps have been in use for a long time then their output may be lower than the nominal output. Similarly if the sign has been running for a long time the build up of dirt on the surfaces may be reducing the light output. Many lamp types are sensitive to changes in temperature so it is important to record the temperature when taking readings. The supply voltage can significantly change the output of some lamps so it is a good idea to measure the supply voltage. As there can be a voltage drop in the supply cabling it is best to measure the voltage in the supply network as close to the luminaires as possible.

Text: 9 Testing and verification For media screens it is necessary to set the whole sign to display white as this is the colour with the highest luminance.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Signs using exposed light sources (e.g. cold cathode tubing) should be measured at right angles to the sign at a distance such that the shortest dimension of the lit area fills a diameter of the viewing circle.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Internally illuminated signs would usually have the maximum value of luminance in the white portion; coloured portions would generally have a luminance value of between 0.02 and 0.80 of the value of the white portion, assuming a uniform illumination and depending on the colour and transmission characteristics of the coloured portions.

Text: 9 Testing and verification Readings should be taken only at night to avoid any contribution from daylight and care should be taken to avoid any misleading readings, such as might be caused by or from other light sources in the measurement field of a luminance meter.

Text: 9 Testing and verification The number of points to measure on is a function of the size of the sign. It is normal to measure the luminance on a regular grid of points with the maximum distance between the points (p) being given by the formula below where d is the distance of p=0.2x5Iogd

Text: 9 Testing and verification the longest side of the sign. The number of polnts in this dimension should be selected so that the distance between them is p or slightly less. Then in the other direction select the number of points necessary to give a similar distance between points thus giving an almost square grid. Table 5, below, gives information on the spacing of measurement points for a range of sign sizes. The points are laid out uniformly across the whole sign with the edge points being a half spacing in from the edge of the sign.

Text: 10 Maintenance There are examples of poorly maintained illuminated advertisements in most areas resulting in, at best, a non-uniform unpleasant appearance and at worst the exposing of the light sources.

Text: 10 Maintenance For any signage to deliver best value, it needs to be maintained throughout its life, although there is no duty to ensure that the illumination is operational unless this is a requirement of the original consent. However, if it is, it should be maintained to ensure that it operates within the design parameters, delivering the expected design performance (illumination and uniformity) throughout the installations life, in accordance with original consent, ensuring that public safety is assured.

Text: 10 Maintenance With advances in technologies the sign design should consider the use of low energy, low maintenance solutions and perhaps with advanced control to ensure that the sign can be adapted in the future. By applying th is approach the installation can optimise maintenance obligations and manage energy use responsibly, thereby reducing the carbon impact of the installation.

Text: TRA004 – Pavement o/s Holland & Barrett, 70 George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1RF We write on behalf of our client, BT, following our pre- application consultation relating to various sites, including the entitled, across your authority for the installation of BT Street Hubs and the associated removal of BT payphone kiosks. BT are moving forward with this case and are applying to Trafford Council for full planning permission and advertisement consent for installation of 1no. BT Street Hub and 2no. associated BT payphones.

Text: TRA004 – Pavement o/s Holland & Barrett, 70 George Street, Altrincham, WA14 1RF To recap, the InLink UK service was first launched in 2017 and since then 494 InLink structures were rolled out in 23 cities. These first-generation units offer 1Gbps free public Wi-Fi, free UK calls, USB charging, an emergency services button and a range of other digital services for those in the vicinity. HD displays on the sides are used to carry advertising, which helped to fund the units and its free services, but the screens can also show local content free of charge. The suppliers of InLinks unfortunately went into administration in 2019 and are no longer able to supply units to BT, hence this product is no longer available. Since then, BT have been working on a new and improved unit of their own, the BT Street Hub 2.0, that they are keen to rollout in your local authority area.

Text: BT Street Hub Project BT Street Hub Project

Text: BT Street Hub Project BT is continuing to move forward with public connectivity and benefits in which BT Street Hubs will provide a sleek and modern answer to the ever-increasing demands of a digitally connected society.

Text: BT Street Hub Project 1

Text: BT Street Hub Project BT Street Hubs have all the existing features of the previous InLink unit but has better Wi-Fi range and capabilities to include environmental sensors, insight counting and small cell mobile connectivity. The addition of the 5G small cells into BT Street Hubs is very much in line with current UK Government’s guidance on communications infrastructure and the National Infrastructure Strategy. This is echoed in the Government’s commitment towards telecommunications deployment which has been strengthened since the conception of InLinks as NPPF 2021, paragraph 114 confirms that; ‘Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being. Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G)’.

Text: BT Street Hub Project Since the rollout of InLinks, there has been increased focus on green initiatives and environmental monitoring. BT Street Hubs take this into account and have sensors that can count pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle movements as well as monitor air, sound and light. This free information has its own dashboard and will help the planning system actively manage patterns of growth in support of national air quality objectives and the Government’s ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. It can be a useful source of real-time data in the delivery of the Council’s own green agenda, travel plans and the data collected can help present a business case for carbon offset credit.

Text: BT Street Hub Project Overall, BT Street Hubs will help future proof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable, while also providing a valuable contribution to the Government’s aim to improve wireless communications across the UK. Investment in the high street is at an all-time low, but that has not slowed BT down as they look to ramp up their rollout of new BT Street Hubs across the UK. They are continuing their commitment to invest and improve in the high street, with one BT Street Hub at a time, and with that decluttering these environments with the associated removal of existing BT phone boxes.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 National Planning Policy Framework, 2021

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied and is a material consideration for both the Full Planning and Advertisement Consent applications.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 In the context of transport related matters as set out in Chapter 9 of NPPF, the following paragraphs are applicable to this BT Street Hub case:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 111 - Development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 112 - Within this context, applications for development should: [...] c) create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, avoid unnecessary street clutter, and respond to local character and design standards.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The NPPF supports the provision of high-quality communications infrastructure as set out in section 10. These relevant paragraphs are highlighted below:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 114 - Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being. Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections. Policies should set out how high-quality digital infrastructure, providing access to services from a range of providers, is expected to be delivered and upgraded over time; and should prioritise full fibre connections to existing and new developments (as these connections will, in almost all cases, provide the optimum solution).

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 115 - The number of radio and electronic communications masts, and the sites for such installations, should be kept to a minimum consistent with the needs of consumers, the efficient operation of the network and providing reasonable capacity for future expansion. Use of existing masts, buildings and other structures for new electronic communications capability (including wireless) should be encouraged. Where new sites are required (such as for new 5G networks, or for connected transport and smart city applications), equipment should be sympathetically designed and camouflaged where appropriate.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 7

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 117 - Applications for electronic communications development (including applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 118 - Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 The NPPF states the following specifically in relation to advertisement control in section 12:

Text: National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 Paragraph 136 - The quality and character of places can suffer when advertisements are poorly sited and designed. A separate consent process within the planning system controls the display of advertisements, which should be operated in a way which is simple, efficient and effective. Advertisements should be subject to control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts.

Text: Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England

Text: Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England The Code of Best Practice has been fully revised, and the latest version was published by DCMS in March 2022. It acknowledges that the planning system plays a key role in delivering the digital infrastructure that we need, in a sustainable and well-designed way, especially as households and businesses become increasingly reliant on mobile connectivity. The principal aim of the Code is to ensure that the Government’s objective of supporting high quality communications infrastructure, which is vital to continued economic prosperity and social inclusion for all, is met. The Code confirms that the development of Wireless Network infrastructure must be achieved in a timely and efficient manner, in a way that balances connectivity requirements with the economic, community and social benefits that this brings with the environmental considerations associated with such development. BT Street Hub has a key role to play in delivering the necessary infrastructure to support the increasing reliance on mobile connectivity at a street level and so accords with the Code of Best Practice.

Text: Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2022 This recent Order, which came into force in April 2022, amends Class A of Part 16 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and relaxes restrictions on developments consisting of the installation of electronic communications apparatus. The planning process is a key part of the development of electronic communications infrastructure, and the changes are hoped to strike a balance between providing a framework that speeds up the delivery of the required infrastructure, as well as encouraging the use and sharing of existing sites and mitigating the impact of new development where that is required. While the main function of the BT Street Hub is to provide the range of communications services previously discussed (in line

Text: Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2022 with Government policy), the structure also incorporates advertisement screens which helps to fund the free features. The BT Street Hub does not benefit from the recently extended Permitted Development Rights because of the dual purpose of the structure, but the principles behind the relaxation of restrictions on electronic communications apparatus are relevant to this application as each unit modular and can accommodate a small cell within it.

Text: Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements As per the Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements (ILP), which is included as one of the accompanying supporting documents for the application, confirms that the maximum permitted luminance of an area up to 10m2 (i.e Street Hub) in a Zone E4 (urban) is 600 cdm-2 at night (page 24 of the ILP). It goes on to state in Note 1, that “during the daytime sign luminance should never exceed 5,000 cdm-2.” As detailed in the BT Street Hub Product Statement, the proposed screens would not exceed 600 candelas between dusk and dawn and 2500 candelas during daylight hours, this is in accordance with industry standards as detailed in the ILP guidance document, see extract below for reference.

Text: Direct conversion Direct conversion

Text: Direct conversion In this instance the proposed BT Street Hub has been progressed as a direction conversion of an existing BT kiosk(s) as it is considered that its siting and appearance continues to fit into its immediate street scene context. It is felt that the BT Street Hub will be a clear improvement from the existing on-site arrangement.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Siting Justification against Planning Policy

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy At the conception stage, we have tried to focus on pursuing direct conversions of existing kiosks wherever practicable when considering the existing street scene layout and furniture. We have looked for locations with wide pavements, and where a site’s relationship with existing street furniture avoids an overwhelming proliferation of street clutter. It should be recognised that BT’s legacy estate of payphones has grown up organically over the years and the location of existing BT kiosks can sometimes sit in street scene environments that have changed completely since they were first established on-site. In some instances, the BT Street Hub project has been seen as an opportunity to improve the pedestrian environment by removing awkward BT kiosks and repositioning the new unit to a more in keeping spot in the street scene.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy It is appreciated that streets are ever-evolving environments, amidst society’s changing connectivity demands. BT has a license and universal service obligation with Ofcom to provide a street level phone service, so the selection process of associated kiosks to be removed has had to take this into account. The new unit provides for free telephone calls, has quick links to charity lines and an emergency 999 button, however, there is a recognition that the use of phone boxes has dramatically changed since kiosks were first conceived, whilst now the need for Wi-Fi and mobile coverage has increased massively. In this respect we have tried to build a sequence of BT Street Hub sites wherever possible, so that this can improve connectivity and the user experience as they travel through an area.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Likewise, as BT Street Hubs can provide the Council with valuable data as each unit has environmental sensors that can monitor air, sound and light, we have tried to plan a sequence of BT Street Hub sites wherever possible, along key routes, so that the information gathered can be better analysed. This free environmental data has its own Council dashboard and will help the planning system actively manage patterns of growth in support of national air quality objectives and will be a useful source of real-time data in the delivery of the Council’s own green agenda. In a similar vein, BT Street Hubs have the capability to monitor pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicle movements, hence in building a strategic

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy 12

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy network of BT Street Hub units it will help the Council to monitor and develop travel plans for the area.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy The introduction of any form of development within a particular environment will always be, to some degree, a noticeable addition or change to those residents, businesses and regular passers-by found closest. However, it should be appreciated that the visibility of something that is new or the change in form that has an established presence on-site, like a telephone kiosk to a BT Street Hub unit with digital advertisements, does not automatically result in an overwhelming adverse harm occurring. The starting point and fundamental principle applied by the applicant is always to replace existing BT phone boxes with BT Street Hub units where they will be in-keeping with their existing surroundings. In this regard it is seen as an opportunity to create an up-to-date network of sites and so help futureproof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy In progressing new BT Street Hub sites, so far as practicable we have sought to minimise the contrast between the development itself and its immediate environment through appropriate siting and design. The siting of each BT Street Hub has been considered having regard to the available footpath widths; the whereabouts of the existing payphones to be removed, and the visual character of the street scene. With regards its associated advertisement screens and as will be discussed later in this statement, careful consideration has been given to its siting whereby the immediate context and public highway safety issues have been taken on board. These criteria have been adjusted where necessary on a site-by-site basis to account for local context and policy requirements when assessing the site’s suitability to accommodate a new BT Street Hub unit.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy Justification for the siting and appearance of the proposed BT Street Hub unit itself, has been assessed against up to date national and local planning policies and any other material considerations. Our assessment has concentrated on whether the removal of the existing BT call boxes when balanced against the replacement of new BT Street Hub with all its added features at the application site, creates a significant visual harm that would outweigh the public benefits.

Text: Siting Justification against Planning Policy In this regard matters of siting, appearance and advertisements are discussed as follows: -

Text: Siting Siting

Text: Siting This proposal involves the removal of 2no BT existing call boxes in association with 1no proposed new BT Street Hub. At a strategic level the removal of these existing phone boxes will declutter street scenes throughout your authority and when comparing the footprint of existing call boxes to be removed and proposed BT Street Hub, it will free up more pedestrian space.

Text: Siting This proposal has been progressed as the direct conversion of an existing BT kiosk on Regent Road. Regent Road is a popular road for motorists, providing a direct route towards George Street and Altrincham transport interchange which are key components of Altrincham town

Text: Siting 13

Text: Siting centre. The Street Hub is proposed to be a direct replacement of an existing BT kiosk on a wide section of pavement which ensures that it’s siting here will not foster any unduly impacts on pedestrian amenity in this location. A BT Street Hub in this location would contribute to a network of proposed sites in Altrincham town centre.

Text: Siting This proposal has been progressed as the direct conversion of an existing back-to-back BT kiosk on George Street. George Street is a busy pedestrianised road and is one of the main high streets in Altrincham town centre with several national chains occupying this road. Given that the Street Hub is proposed to be positioned in the exact footprint of the existing BT kiosk, it is felt that it’s siting here would not foster any unduly effects on pedestrian amenity in this location. It is felt that the removal of the existing BT kiosks and their subsequent replacement with a modern BT Street Hub unit would enhance this modern part of Altrincham. A BT Street Hub in this location would contribute to a sequence of proposed sites along George Street and Altrincham town centre.

Text: Siting It is concluded that the siting of the proposed Street Hub is acceptable and is in accordance with the applicable national and local planning policies.

Text: Siting Appearance

Text: Siting The proposed BT Street Hub 2.0 unit is an advanced, modern development which has been designed following significant improvements in technology and digital content over recent years from when BTs first generation unit, InLink was rolled out. It can promote the image of the authority as a vibrant place, in which we believe it will improve the quality of the immediate streetscape for residents, businesses and visitors.

Text: Siting The proposed design is slimmer and takes a more compact profile than the existing BT payphone boxes that the proposed BT Street Hub is replacing. The user interface is located at a low level and is a similar height to an existing BT payphone unit to ensure that it is accessible to all users.

Text: Siting The appearance of the BT Street Hub unit has a vertical emphasis and by reason of its reduced footprint would give a slender, more elegant form of development when compared to an existing payphone kiosk. The appearance of the structure is not considered to be overly harmful to the wider street scene, especially when considering the nature of the existing payphones to be removed. Its height and dimensions are justified when considering the features, it incorporates such as small cell, in which we believe the appearance of the area will not be compromised by the proposed new BT Street Hub.

Text: Siting The new structure will be set within a generally commercial setting and busy stretch of road that is dominated by pedestrian movements; hence it is well-lit throughout the day. While it is accepted that

Text: Siting 14

Text: Siting the BT Street Hub advertisements will be more visible during the hours of darkness or in dull conditions, such matters can be controlled by condition and can be operated in accordance with levels of illumination as set out in the Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements' 2015. In this respect the digital screens will be operated within UK industry standards appropriate for the area and so their presence would not be appeared untoward with this stretch of road which is well lit by streetlights and window displays. In this context, the BT Street Hub design would not appear detrimental to the amenity of this locality, most notably the setting of the Conservation Area.

Text: Siting It is concluded that the dimensions and design of the proposed BT Street Hub are justified, and its appearance is an improvement when compared to the BT call boxes that are to be removed. Furthermore, the added features and communications facilities within the new unit are in full accordance with the Government’s digital policies and strategy which seek to promote improved connectivity. When balanced against such matters, it is considered that the appearance of the proposed BT Street Hub itself is acceptable and is in accordance with national and local planning policies.

Text: Pavement Width Pavement Width

Text: Pavement Width The total existing pavement width at this location is 10000mm. The total width of the BT Street Hub is 1236mm (tapering down to a footprint width of 1201mm on the pavement). With the BT Street Hub being located 500mm off the kerb, the remaining available footway allows for safe circulation space around the unit and will not restrict passing pedestrians’ movements. It is of note that the structure is only 350mm wide, so any minor narrowing of the footway occurs for just a few centimetres.

Text: Advertisements Advertisements

Text: Advertisements When seen in the overarching context of the street scene, it is considered that the location, size and height of the digital advertisement panels will, on balance, be acceptable. As previously discussed, it is believed that the siting and appearance of the BT Street Hub would not create significant harm to the amenity of the area that would outweigh the public benefits and other material factors of consideration.

Text: Advertisements In terms of public safety, the site of the BT Street Hub and the display of digital advertisements on its sides will allow for the continued safe movements of motorists and pedestrians. In this regard, its presence within the street scene would not endanger public safety of those people who are taking reasonable care for their own and others’ safety.

Text: Advertisements It is recognised that all advertisements are intended to attract people’s attention, however in this case their siting and size would not create an untoward feature within the street scene. The position

Text: Advertisements 15

Text: Advertisements where the BT Street Hub is to be located and the orientation of the advertisement screens in relation to the road would not cause unacceptable interference with nearby road signs and or navigational lights. Viewed within the street scene setting, the digital advertisements would be seen by passing pedestrians / motorists but would not create confusion nor influence the behaviour of drivers to such a degree that they would cause a hazard by reason of their presence. The proposed BT Street Hub would be sited away from road junctions so it would not unduly interrupt any visibility splays or sightlines. When viewed within the street scene context of the wider environment, it is considered that the BT Street Hub would not appear as an inappropriate feature to motorists.

Text: Advertisements With regards pedestrian safety, the BT Street Hub is positioned away from the road edge on a wide section of pavement without impeding pedestrian movements as ample footway width would be retained. Allowing for the orientation of the BT Street Hub’s user interface in relation to passing motorists, the public safety of those using it would not be put at risk as they would be set off the kerb edge.

Text: Advertisements The proposed usage for the screens has been set in line with Transport for London’s (TfL) policy document ‘Guidance for Digital Roadside Advertising and Proposed Best Practice – 2013’ [the TfL Guidance]. Each BT Street Hub location has been assessed against and would comply with the following additional criteria from the TfL Guidance.

Text: Advertisements • There would be no conflict with any traffic signs, signals, crossing points, schools, hospitals or low bridges.

Text: Advertisements • No sightlines or clearances would be affected.

Text: Advertisements • The TfL guidance states that ‘Static digital advertising is likely to be acceptable in locations where static advertising exists or would be accepted.’ There are existing traditional advertisement on similar sections of the respective roads in many cases.

Text: Advertisements • The geometry of the roads are not complicated and the driving conditions are not considered to be demanding or complicated.

Text: Advertisements • The advertisements would not be experienced by a driver in conjunction with any other similar digital advertisements.

Text: Advertisements • As per the TfL guidance, the advertisements would be located as close to the driver’s natural eye line as possible and facing as head-on to the traffic as is practical.

Text: Advertisements The lighting levels noted above are within the levels set for this type and size of screen (those under 10m2) as set by the Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements (2015). A copy of this document is appended for clarity.

Text: Advertisements It should be noted that the digital screens can be used by the Council as there is 5% free screen time allocated on each BT Street Hub unit. BT are also gifting free advertising space to nominated small businesses which is an added benefit to the local economy.

Text: Planning Conditions Planning Conditions

Text: Planning Conditions To give assurance that each Street Hub will operate as intended and the associated payphone removals will occur, we would be pleased to accept the following conditions or a mutually agreed version of them to be included as part of any planning consent:

Text: Planning Conditions A. Within three (3) months of development commencing the existing BT payphones shown above shall be removed in their entirety and the land made good to the same condition as the adjacent land.

Text: Planning Conditions B. Pavement surrounding the Street Hub shall be made good to the same condition as the adjacent land.

Text: Planning Conditions C. The intensity of the illumination of the two digital display screens shall not exceed 600 candelas per square metre (cd/m2) between dusk and dawn, and 2,500 candelas per square metre (cd/m2) during the daytime, in line with the maximum permitted recommended luminance as set out by 'The Institute of Lighting Professional's 'Professional Lighting Guide 05: The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements'.

Text: Planning Conditions D. The digital display screens shall not display any moving, or apparently moving, images (including animation, flashing, scrolling three dimensional, intermittent or video elements).

Text: Planning Conditions E. The minimum display time for each piece of content on the digital display screens shall be 10 seconds.

Text: Planning Conditions F. The interval between each piece of content on the digital display screens shall take place over a period no greater than one second; the complete screen shall change with no visual effects (including swiping or other animated transition methods) between displays and the display will include a mechanism to freeze the image in the event of a malfunction.

Text: Planning Conditions G. No content on the digital display screens shall resemble traffic signs, as defined in section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

Text: Planning Conditions H. This advertisement consent shall remain valid for a period of 10 years from the date of consent.

Text: Planning Conditions To justify condition Has suggested above it is recognised that advertisement consent usually lasts for 5 years, however a local planning authority has discretion on this matter and can grant consent for a longer or shorter period. Even where advertisement consent is only granted for a period of 5 years, the advert may continue to remain in place after that period without submitting any further application (under Class 14 deemed consent). After the expiry of the 5 years initial consent, the local planning authority has the power to issue a discontinuance notice on the advert if they feel that such action is necessary to remedy a substantial injury to the amenity of the locality.

Text: Planning Conditions Should your Council wish to append any other conditions to either the full planning or advertisement application, we would be most grateful if you could discuss these with us at your earliest opportunity during the determination process.

Text: Planning Conditions 17

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion BT Street Hubs have the potential to significantly enhance the provision of local community communications facilities and services. It is precisely the type of high-speed digital infrastructure that the Government is seeking to support as part of the presumption in favour of sustainable development. It will deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits by providing a suite of essential urban tools/services, including free ultrafast Wi-Fi to residents, businesses and visitors in this area. Overall BT Street Hubs will help future proof the high street making them smarter, safer, and more sustainable.

Text: Conclusion The proposed BT Street Hubs structures are of a high quality, accessible design that would be a significant improvement when compared to the existing BT payphones that are to be replaced. We consider the proposal in this case to be appropriately sited; to reduce street clutter, to improve available footway widths, not to negatively affect heritage assets nor adversely affect the visual amenity or public safety. We believe this statement has demonstrated that the BT Street Hub proposal is in accordance with national policy set out in the NPPF and local development plan policies, in which we would hope that this application can be supported by your Council.
