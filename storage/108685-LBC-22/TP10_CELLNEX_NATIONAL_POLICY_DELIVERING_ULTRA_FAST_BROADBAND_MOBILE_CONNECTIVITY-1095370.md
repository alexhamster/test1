Text: Background Background

Text: Background 1.

Text: Background Telecommunications is a public utility that was provided by the Post Office until the decision was taken in the early 1980’s to privatise this service. This was achieved through the Telecommunications Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) and it was under Section 7 that the original mobile network operators (MNOs) were granted licenses. The Communications Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) ended the licensing regime established by the 1984 Act, but the operators retained their special status as Electronic Communications Code Network Operators (Code Operators, previously Telecommunications Code Systems Operators). The 2003 Act widened the opportunity for operators to become Code Operators, a

Text: Background 2.

Text: Background Although the MNOs are private companies, they all therefore provide a public service and one which is recognised as being essential to a modern economy. Setting aside the large contribution made by the electronic communications industry to the economy through direct employment and the sale of products and services, the local benefits will be varied and considerable. In addition, as the technology continues to improve, and the range of services become more varied and innovative, the benefits will also expand at a fast pace. A connected and modern smart phone is now able to access thousands of applications, which means that it is almost impossible to now quantify or specify all the potential benefits.

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity Since the first mobile phone call was made in the UK in 1985, the mobile industry has delivered huge benefits to consumers and the wider UK economy. New mobile technologies - or generations - have been introduced roughly every 10 years, each offering improved services compared with previous generations. However, the existing 4G network rollout has been relatively rapid and MNOs are now deploying 5G which has meant that the timescales between mobile technologies has now reduced even further:

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 1G: the first generation of ‘cellular’ mobile phones, which used analogue radio transmission and supported voice calls;

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 2G: the second generation of mobiles, which used digital transmission and allowed for digital phone calls and messaging;

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 3G: the third generation of mobile communications enabled faster data services than those available on 2G networks, which led to the first consumer friendly mobile broadband internet experience for users; and

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 4G: the fourth generation of mobile communications is a more data-oriented network than its predecessors and is the first all-Internet Protocols mobile communications system. The main advantage of 4G services compared with previous generations are that they offer faster download speeds and quicker response times (latency).

Text: Growth of Mobile Connectivity 5G: this next generation of mobile connectivity will deliver a step change of ultrafast, ultra-low latency, reliable, mobile connectivity, that is able to support ever larger data requirements, as well as wide-ranging new applications including machine to machine applications - intelligent machines that require no human input (e.g. advanced manufacturing). 5G will deliver these flexible networks by making use of multiple bands of spectrum.

Text: Source: Figure 2 from Ofcom’s “Enabling 5G in the UK” (March 2018) New generations of mobile connectivity reflect the insatiable public demand for mobile connectivity across the UK. They are supported by Government due to the significant economic and social benefits. There are many reports highlighting the significant growth and benefits of mobile connectivity. More recently, Ofcom’s Communications Market Report August 2019 and Connected Nations Report Spring 2019, together with Deloitte’s Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2018 advise:

Text: Source: Figure 2 from Ofcom’s “Enabling 5G in the UK” (March 2018) Financial contribution - the UK telecoms sector continues to make an important contribution to the overall economy, generating £33.8bn in operator-reported revenue in 2018. The Gross Value Added (GVA) benefits of 5G will be multiples of this. There are around 92.5 million active mobile subscriptions at the end of 2018, completely outstripping fixed phone lines.

Smartphone penetration has seen growth across all age groups and the 55-75 category has seen the most growth increasing from 40% in 2013 to 77% in 2018. Smartphones are the most frequently used devices in the UK: 95% of smartphones owners aged 16-75 used their device in the last day and so are simply now a key part of modern life.

Text: Source: Figure 2 from Ofcom’s “Enabling 5G in the UK” (March 2018) Demand – The average mobile data consumption has increased rapidly in 2018, with the average monthly use per mobile data connection increasing by 25% to 2.9GB. This will continue to grow, not just through smartphone use and new “apps”, but the 5G network will facilitate a whole range of data intensive uses like autonomous vehicles, remote reporting, smart medical and other public service functions.

Text: Source: Figure 2 from Ofcom’s “Enabling 5G in the UK” (March 2018) The financial contribution to the UK economy is significant. In May 2018, the Financial Times article “UK digital technology sector outpacing wider economy” explained that the digital tech sector was worth £184bn to the UK economy in 2017, up from £170bn in 2016. This has significantly increased on those figures within the UK Government’s Information Economy Strategy (June 2013), that estimated that the digital sector alone contributed around £105 billion in GVA to the UK in 2011.

Text: Source: Figure 2 from Ofcom’s “Enabling 5G in the UK” (March 2018) The Department for Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) indicate in its Sectors Economic Estimates August 2017, that the GVA contribution of telecoms sector represented 1.8% of the total UK GVA in 2017, so a significant contributor to the UK Economy and having grown 31% over the period 2010 - 2017. The roll- out of 4G in the UK has been estimated to deliver £75 billion of additional GDP over ten years (http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/4g-everything-everywhere-75bn-lte- economy-334922). New research from Barclays Corporate Banking (April 2019) suggests that 5G could supercharge the UK economy by up to £15.7

Text: Improving Social Well - Being Mobile communications can help parents interact with children far away, for example, a divorced father can play a game on line with a child many miles away.

Text: Improving Social Well - Being Reliable mobile connectivity gives people the choice to elect not to have a fixed line. At a time when nearly everyone has a mobile, a low income household with no or little mobile connectivity may still have to pay for both. Better mobile connectivity and availability can mean that a household can save on the fixed line costs, which to them would be an appreciable saving.

This can bring about an improved balance between home and working life. At the same time, it can help minimise private car movements and so help reduce peak period congestion and pollution. This is a particularly important benefit when transport policy to reduce travel and CO2 emissions seems to be failing.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy From the above, it is clear why the Digital Economy in all its forms, including fixed and mobile communications networks, is a significant priority for the UK and Devolved Governments and reflected in their various ‘Digital Strategies’.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy 9.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy In terms of mobile connectivity, the UK Government is focused on supporting mobile connectivity and next generation technologies within a more facilitating legislative framework. So, this has seen, for example, the introduction of the new Electronic Communications Code allowing more economic access to sites, further relaxation of permitted development rights and greater protection to existing network infrastructure including digital connectivity forming part of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy 10.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy All four MNOs have now acquired, through Government spectrum auctions, frequencies that will be used to allow capacity improvements to existing networks and those suitable for deploying. Other spectrum, such as that to be released by clearing terrestrial television from the 700MHz spectrum will also allow 5G, mostly likely geared more towards low capacity wide area coverage, with a particular focus on rural connectivity. The 26GHz and above radio spectrum is likely to be used, in the future, for very dense and high capacity 5G coverage in towns and cities.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy 11.

Text: Delivering the UK Digital Strategy All of this means that we can expect to see significant Government emphasis and MNO delivery priorities towards:

The Government advises that 5G is the first generation of mobile technology that has been designed to support multiple applications, from mobile broadband and entertainment services, to industrial applications such as robotics and logistics. These applications will be delivered through different combinations of the three broad capabilities of 5G:

Text: Support from the Planning System The improvement of existing mobile networks and the delivery of 5G (and future generations of connectivity) requires a supportive legislative and policy framework, including the UK town planning systems.

Text: Support from the Planning System 20. National policy of all Governments, reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in England, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP), Planning Policy Wales and the Strategic Planning Policy Statement for Northern Ireland, is to support the provision of advanced mobile connectivity to help underpin and

Text: Support from the Planning System sustain national, regional and local economies. Mobile connectivity has become akin to the “fourth utility”, with commensurately high public reliance and expectation of an ubiquitous service. Within Appendix 1 we set out the main Government policy and objectives across the UK to support mobile connectivity.

Text: Support from the Planning System 21. What is wholly consistent within this overarching national planning policy support towards better connectivity, is that local planning authorities should not challenge whether a particular service is needed, but only the site-specific matters and justification considered against local policy and guidance. However, local planning authorities should recognise that without the deployment of next generation mobile connectivity like 5G, it is unlikely that the local planning authority will be able to meet other key policy objectives such as building sustainable communities, attracting new inward investment and delivering smart services.

Text: Support from the Planning System 22.

Text: Support from the Planning System It is very evident that the UK town planning systems have a major responsibility in helping to deliver these network changes and improvements in the public interest. The supportive national policy framework will also have to be reflected at local level through an appropriate policy framework that can be translated into balanced and positive development management decisions. This will require meaningful engagement with the industry and as well as effective decision making by local planning authorities. It will inevitably require proper balancing between operational and environmental considerations, particularly in the most sensitive of locations (like protected areas) where rural communities exist and aspire to have similar levels of mobile connectivity comparable to other urban areas of the UK. Although radio signals are invisible, the systems cannot operate without the necessary infrastructure system, which is no different from other forms of public communications infrastructure. For example, a railway network very obviously requires tracks, stations and parking facilities, whereas a mobile network requires a series of base stations, with communication masts, radio equipment housing and other associated
