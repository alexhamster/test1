Text: Comment Details Comment:I have seen the revised plans uploaded today.The proposed rear elevation shown doesn't accord with the construction work that I can see. There is only one item that might be a proposed roof light not three.There remain the original 2 rear windows rather than one being converted into a Juliet balcony.No additional window appears to be being created which would be required if one of the existing ones is to become the Juliet one-the rendering has all been done. I am more than happy for there to be no Juliet balcony !

Text: Comment Details I have seen the comments from No. 7 Canon Drive and agree with the sentiments expressed in that.

Text: Comment Details I am therefore still puzzled about what is happening.
