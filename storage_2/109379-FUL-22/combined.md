Text: 1. INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION

Text: BRIEF BRIEF

Text: BRIEF 1.1

Text: BRIEF This application is submitted on behalf of Mr B Hodkinson (hereafter referred to as “the applicant”) in respect of a proposed alterations to the upper floors of an existing Class E unit, to enable the creation of 2no. one bedroom apartments.

Text: BRIEF BACKGROUND

Text: BRIEF 1.2 This application site comprises two existing Class E units that are operated simultaneously by the same owners, 41 Oxford Road is a health food store, whilst 43 Oxford Road is a vegetarian restaurant.

Text: BRIEF 1.3

Text: BRIEF To the first and second floors of the Class E units there is currently underused space, which primarily accommodates w/cs associated with the restaurant, storage space and office/administration space associated with the existing Class E uses.

Text: BRIEF 1.4

Text: BRIEF The immediately surrounding area comprises a mixed use area, with commercial uses to the ground floor of many properties and residential uses to upper floors.

Text: BRIEF 1.5

Text: BRIEF According to the adopted Local Plan Proposals Map the site falls within a Conservation Area and the ‘Town and District Shopping Centre’ allocation. It is therefore the case that the presumption in favour of sustainable development applies in this circumstance and development should be approved without delay, subject to the impact upon the Conservation Area.

Text: BRIEF PURPOSE

Text: STATUTORY AND OTHER DESIGNATIONS STATUTORY AND OTHER DESIGNATIONS

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.1

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS The application site does not include any listed buildings. It is however located within a Conservation Area (CA).

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.2

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS The Downs Conservation Area was originally designated in 1973, it has subsequently been extended periodically, the application site was eventually included in the Conservation Area in 2013/14. The Downs CA has five character zones, the application site is located within Character Zone B described as The Downs Commercial Area.

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.3

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS The CA Appraisal states that this character zone is: “now more commercial in character and comprises both sides of the lower part of The Downs, and those parts of Ashley Road closest to the town centre and all of Oxford Road. Some of the area was developed in the late 18th and early 19th century, however most of the buildings date from later in the 19th century and some more recent additions. Here the majority of the structures are Victorian, mainly three-storey buildings converted to commercial usage in the later 19th century or else purpose-built. The prevalent building material is brick with blue slate used for roofs. Yards to the rear are smaller or non-existent or have been built up and converted to parking. Some buildings have elaborate polychrome brick designs, dormers and decorative ridges and retain elements of the early shop

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS fronts.”

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.4

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS The CA Appraisal notes that there are no listed buildings in this character zone. All properties on Oxford Road are identified as being ‘positive buildings’ to the CA.

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.5

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS In general, the CA Appraisal notes that the majority of buildings are in good condition, however it acknowledges that a number of properties are deteriorating particularly in Character Zone B. This is largely due to the commercial nature of this area and the associated paraphernalia, such as signage and street clutter. The Appraisal also notes the impact of changes to the rear of these commercial properties that harm their character, such as incongruous ventilation systems.

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.6

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS The CA Appraisal acknowledges the pressures affecting this CA, in particular for the commercial areas it acknowledges the problem of businesses remaining economically viable particularly as this area is further from the main footfall and has more limited parking.

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.7

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS With regard to residential areas the CA Appraisal states that demand for housing is high, due to the quality and attractiveness particularly of historic properties and proximity to services and schools. Nevertheless, there is pressure to introduce adaptations for 21st century living. There is evidence that buildings have evolved over time as well as changed use and there is no reason for this not to continue as long as it is not detrimental to overall character and appearance, according to the CA Appraisal.

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 7

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS 3.8

Text: HERITAGE DESIGNATIONS With regards to the additional area added into the CA in 2013/14, i.e. Oxford Road, the CA Appraisal acknowledges that in part, the inclusion of these buildings and spaces will also provide a buffer zone around the Conservation Area, to protect and enhance the character of this area and ensure that no further inappropriate modern development takes place.

Text: INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION

Text: INTRODUCTION 5.1

Text: INTRODUCTION Paragraph 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) refers to Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and states that:

Text: INTRODUCTION “Planning law requires that applications for planning permission must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise”

Text: INTRODUCTION 5.2

Text: INTRODUCTION The adopted Development Plan for Trafford comprises the Core Strategy document which was formally adopted in January 2012 and relevant SPDS. The revised NPPF, published in July 2021, is a material consideration for development management purposes, along with the emerging Development Plan and the emerging Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF).

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY The Core Strategy includes the following policies relevant to the proposed development:

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • Policy L7: Design – this policy states that in matters of design, development must be appropriate in its context; make best use of opportunities to improve the character and quality of an area; enhance the street scene or character of the area by appropriately addressing scale, density, height, massing, layout, elevation treatment, materials, hard and soft landscaping works, boundary treatment and make appropriate provision for open space where appropriate.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY •

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY It goes on to state that satisfactory vehicular access and egress should be provided; sufficient off street parking and manoeuvring space should be provided as appropriate; and development should be satisfactorily served by the necessary utilities.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • Development should be compatible with the surrounding area and should not prejudice the amenity of future occupiers and/or occupants of adjacent properties.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • Development should be designed in a way that reduces the opportunities for crime and not have an adverse impact on public safety;

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • Development must be fully accessible by all sections of the community; it should provide good connections within the site and to adjoining areas and provide safe, convenient links to public transport.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 5.4

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY Policy L7 mostly relates to larger scale development, as opposed to the small scale creation of 2no. apartments proposed herein. However, a response is provided to the relevant parts of this policy:

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • The proposal is entirely compatible with the surrounding uses, conversion of the upper

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 10

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY floors to apartments is commonplace on Oxford Road and in fact the application site is one of few yet to do so.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY • There will be no alterations to the front of the property. The only external change will be the installation of an external stair at the rear to provide access to the apartments.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 5.5

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY Policy R1 Historic Environment: this policy states that all new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness. Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 5.6

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY It is noted throughout this statement that the property falls within The Downs Conservation Area, in particular it lies within Character Zone B – the commercial area. This area was added to the Conservation Area more recently (i.e. it was not part of the original Conservation Area) part of the reasoning behind this addition was to create a buffer between the original Conservation Area and the continued built up area. It is therefore considered that this side of Oxford Road, being the more commercial side, in fact contributes little to the character of the area.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 5.7

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY In any event, the proposed residential conversion of the upper floors is considered to have a minimal yet positive impact on the Conservation Area by bringing about a positive use of this space, adding natural surveillance to the area. Conversion of the upper floors will mean this area of the property continues to be maintained, this in turn will contribute positively to the Conservation Area.

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY 5.8

Text: TRAFFORD CORE STRATEGY It is therefore considered that the proposed development does not have any detrimental impact upon the Conservation Area, in fact it is considered that the proposals will better reveal the historic merit of this property and strengthen the character of the streetscene.

Text: SUMMARY SUMMARY

Text: SUMMARY The proposal would be entirely acceptable and in accordance with Local Plan policy.

Text: SUMMARY 5.10

Text: SUMMARY It has been demonstrated above that the proposed development complies with the provisions of the Development Plan. Commensurate with Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 the application should be approved unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

Text: SUMMARY 5.11 We now go on to discuss other material considerations relevant to the determination of the subject application in Chapter 6.

Text: SUMMARY 11

Text: OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Text: INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION

Text: INTRODUCTION 6.1

Text: INTRODUCTION Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires applications to be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

Text: INTRODUCTION “In principle...any consideration which relates to the use and development of land is capable of being a planning consideration. Whether a particular consideration falling within that broad class is material in any given case will depend on the circumstances” (Stringer v MHLG 1971).

Text: INTRODUCTION 6.2

Text: INTRODUCTION Material considerations must be genuine planning considerations, i.e. they must be related to the development and use of land in the public interest. The considerations must also fairly and reasonably relate to the application concerned (R v Westminster CC ex-parte Monahan 1989 refers).

Text: INTRODUCTION 6.3 In this case the following material considerations are relevant.

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL 6.4

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL As reference throughout this statement, the property falls within The Downs Conservation Area. Section 3 of this statement details the Conservation Area Appraisal and as such this information is not repeated here.

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL 6.5 However, it is stated that the proposed development has carefully considered its position in the Conservation Area.

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL 6.6

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL There will be no external alterations to the front of the property, as such, there will be no visual impact to the CA.

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL 6.7

Text: THE DOWNS CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL It is further noted that the CA Appraisal acknowledges that some of the areas added into the CA during 2013/14 were done so, in part, to provide a buffer to the heart of the CA. Oxford Road is a peripheral part of the CA added in 2013/14, it could therefore be said to be a buffer location. The proposals herein are small scale and the impact they do have on the CA is considered to be beneficial, as described throughout this statement. It is therefore stated that the proposed development does not have a detrimental impact on the CA, and this has been carefully considered throughout the design process.

Text: NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY & GUIDANCE NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY & GUIDANCE

Text: NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY & GUIDANCE 6.8 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was revised in July 2021 and sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how they should be applied.

Text: NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY & GUIDANCE 12

Text: STATUS STATUS

Text: STATUS 6.9 Paragraph 1 of the Framework states that:

Text: STATUS “The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the Government’s planning

Text: STATUS policies for England and how these are expected to be applied.”

Text: STATUS Paragraph 8 of the NPPF defines ‘sustainable development’ and states it has:

Text: STATUS “three overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways (so opportunities can be taken to secure net gains across each of the different objectives):

Text: STATUS • An economic objective – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;

Text: STATUS • A social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and supports communities’ health, social and cultural well-being; and

Text: STATUS • An environmental objective – to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources and prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy”.

Text: STATUS Paragraph 130 states that planning policies and decisions should ensure that developments:

Text: STATUS • will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;

Text: STATUS • are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;

Text: STATUS • are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change (such as increased densities);

Text: STATUS • establish or maintain a strong sense of place, using the arrangement of streets, spaces, building types and materials to create attractive, welcoming and distinctive places to live, work and visit;

Text: STATUS optimise the potential of the site to accommodate and sustain an appropriate amount and mix of development (including green and other public space) and support local facilities and transport networks; and

Text: STATUS •

Text: STATUS create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-

Text: STATUS 13

Text: STATUS being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users46; and where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the quality of life or community cohesion and resilience.

Text: STATUS 6.12

Text: STATUS Paragraph 202 states that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.

Text: STATUS 6.13

Text: STATUS Paragraph 206 goes on to note that Local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within Conservation Areas and World Heritage Sites, and within the setting of heritage assets, to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably

Text: CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS

Text: CONCLUSIONS 6.14 Taking into account the planning policy and guidance at a national level and the other material considerations, the proposals would comprise high quality, sustainable development and should be approved without delay.

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS This application is submitted on behalf of Mr B Hodkinson (“the applicant”) in respect of a proposed alterations to the upper floors of an existing Class E unit, to enable the creation of 2no. one bedroom apartments.

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS 7.2

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS The site is not constrained by any local, regional or national statutory or non-statutory designations that would preclude its development in the manner proposed. Albeit it is within a Conservation Area, however the impact on the CA has been assessed and considered to be minimal, if not in fact positive.

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS 7.3

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS The proposals are in a sustainable location, in close proximity to the road network, bus network and passenger railway network, making it a highly sustainable site from an accessibility point of view.

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS There are no technical reasons why the proposed change of use cannot be allowed.

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS 7.5

Text: SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND CONCLUSIONS Similar conversion of upper floors to apartments have been approved and found to be in accordance with the Development Plan at adjacent and neighbouring properties, it is therefore respectfully requested that the same conclusion be drawn herein, and that this sustainable development is approved without delay.
