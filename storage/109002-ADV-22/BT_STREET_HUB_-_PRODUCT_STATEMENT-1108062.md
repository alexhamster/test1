Text: Our approach Our approach

Text: Our approach Our approach to planning is to be collaborative with councils wherever possible, working closely with relevant stakeholders to identify suitable sites for Street Hubs and to select which payphones are to be removed.

Text: Our approach Once the appropriate permissions have been gained we progress with removals and installations with the minimal possible disruption to residents and businesses.

Text: Our approach Activation is as automated as possible to minimise the time our engineers spend setting-up and checking the units are ready for service.

Text: Our approach We welcome the opportunity to collaborate on all stages of the rollout in an area wherever possible.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications Street Hub design and specifications

Text: Street Hub design and specifications Street Hubs are free-standing structures featuring a fully accessible tablet interface and digital HD display screens on two sides. Overall Street Hub dimensions are 35cm deep and 123.6cm wide (reduced tapered footprint is 120.1cm), with a height of 298cm to maximise the Wi-Fi range without dominating the street. A narrow base limits the footprint while ensuring access to wheelchair users.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications The screens display content at 10-second intervals, both the commercial content that funds the service as well as a wide range of local community and council content.

Text: Street Hub design and specifications The two screens automatically dim at night to 600cd/m2, following daylight hours and in accordance with the levels set for this type and size of screen (those under 10m) by the Institute of Lighting Professionals, Professional Lighting Guide 05 2015:

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Our Wi-Fi in detail

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Street Hubs connect their communities to the fastest and most robust free public Wi-Fi service in the UK, 1Gbps within 150m. Full fibre connectivity enables speeds up to 13.91 times faster than standard fixed line home broadband and can handle large numbers of connected users without any reduction in speed.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail An omnidirectional outdoor Wi-Fi access point at the top of each Street Hub is connected directly to the fibre broadband network, with co-channel interference mitigated by directing Wi-Fi signals away from neighbouring access points. Our full fibre solution allows capacity upgrades by orders of magnitude (e.g. 1Gbps to 10Gbps) without street works.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Signing up is simple – a one-time email address registration allows automatic connection whenever a user is in range of an active Street Hub. Our customer-first policy means we don’t sell email addresses on, and have no pop-up adverts when users reconnect. Content filtering also prohibits access to adults-only websites.

Text: Our Wi-Fi in detail Where a ‘superconnected cities’ public Wi-Fi service is already provided to the council by BT, this signal can also be broadcast from all Street Hubs in that city at no additional charge.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Combating anti-social behaviour

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Street Hubs are operated in accordance with the Street Hub Anti-Social Behaviour Management Plan that was developed with assistance from the police and a number of local authorities.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour where a Street Hub has been misused to buy illegal drugs. Subject to internal processes, the police can ‘whitelist’ a specific number where there is an operational need, i.e. involved in an active investigation.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Automatic anti-social call blocking technology uses anonymised data to identify suspicious call patterns and phone numbers. Identified numbers are blocked on Street Hubs across the UK, while still allowing genuine users to benefit from the free phone call service.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour People can contact StreetHub@bt.com to report technical issues, antisocial behaviour involving a Street Hub, or to claim their number has been flagged in error. Their case will be considered in

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Depending on circumstances, other measures can be taken including further reducing call volumes, restricting calls at certain times, or only allowing headset calls.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour consultation with the police and local council where appropriate. This option will be highlighted on the screen when a call is attempted to a restricted number. Emails sent from police.uk or .gov email addresses will be treated as a priority.

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Recommendations from groups like the police may mean quicker implementation of measures, for example temporarily restricting mobile calls

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Should it not be possible or convenient to send an email, it’s possible to call the Street Hub helpline on 0800661610 (open 24 hours 7 days).

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour As BT is designated by OFCOM as a Universal Service Provider of public call boxes, any decision to restrict phone service will need to be made exclusively by BT. Decisions to change any service will be based on details provided by police and local authorities:

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour A description of the issue and when it occurred / occurs

Text: Combating anti-social behaviour Location of the Street Hub(s) involved and how they contributed.

Text: Air quality monitoring Air quality monitoring

Text: Air quality monitoring Across the UK, we’re trialling air quality monitoring equipment within Street Hubs. The information from these sensors could be used by participating (and interested) councils and researchers to complement other data sources and improve local decision making.

Text: Air quality monitoring Councils adopting Street Hub are invited to express interest in being involved in this trial. Feedback from participants will guide how the data is communicated and used.

Text: Air quality monitoring Initially, we’re looking at the potential measurement of the following elements of air pollution:

Text: Air quality monitoring • Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Nitric Oxide (NO).

Text: Air quality monitoring Further work is being undertaken on the possible measurement of:

Text: Air quality monitoring • Ground Ozone Level (O3)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Particles (PM2.5)

Text: Air quality monitoring • Particles (PM10)

Text: Air quality monitoring Sulphur Dioxide (SO2).

Text: Air quality monitoring Measurement for each of the above are being assessed on their individual merits, and a decision of which to include in a given Street Hub and when has not yet been made.

Text: Air quality monitoring “We are excited to be working with BT to equip their street furniture with our innovative technology to monitor and reduce carbon emissions. This will help local authorities monitor their carbon footprint in real-time, identify the best opportunities to cut emissions, and access new funding for the necessary investments. At scale, the UK could become the first nation to continuously monitor carbon emissions over its entire territory. This would boost its goal of net zero by 2050.”
