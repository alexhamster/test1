Text: Impact Assessment Impact Assessment

Text: Impact Assessment This Heritage Statement is submitted to support applications for Full Planning and Advertisement Consent on behalf of BT as part of the upgrade of their existing kiosk estate in Trafford. It should be read in conjunction with the Planning, Design and Access Statement submitted to the LPA.

Text: Impact Assessment In submitting these applications specific regard has been had to the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, (the Act) published Government guidance and the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Network Development. Special regard has also been given to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character, appearance and setting of nearby Conservation Areas and any other relevant historical assets in accordance with the Act. The adopted polices of the Trafford Local Plan have also been adhered to, SO8 - Protect the historic built environment.

Text: Impact Assessment The application site is located along a well-lit stretch of pavement on George Street, which is a busy public highway for pedestrian traffic. The area is predominantly made up of retail outlets at ground level including Marks & Spencer directly adjacent to the

Text: Impact Assessment site. There is an array of established street furniture along this section of pavement including signposts, benches and bollards. It is also noted that other types of advertisements and fascia signs have been accepted in the vicinity, some of which are illuminated. These are located primarily at the ground level of nearby shops.

Text: Impact Assessment Whilst these modern, commercial surroundings are seen as an entirely appropriate location for a BT Street Hub unit, it is noted that the site is found within the George Street Conservation Area. Whilst the important scenic, historic and architectural features of this building and wider area are noted, it is argued that the primary setting of the application site outside Marks & Spencer is one that is dominated by modern shop frontages and illuminated advertisements with fascial signage.

Text: Impact Assessment It needs to be reiterated that the development in question is for the upgrade of existing pieces of street furniture found. Given these telephone booths with their incorporated advertisements have already been accepted as part of this historical environment, the proposed BT Street Hub development will be able to effectively assimilate into a busy street scene where the precedent for modern communication infrastructure has already been set. As such due to the scale of development and wider setting of the locality, any impact by the proposal on the Conservation Areas is expected to be minimal.

Text: Impact Assessment Furthermore, it is considered that any minor to negligible harm that could be caused would be significantly outweighed by the removal of the two existing BT kiosks and the myriad of public benefits the Street Hub will bring to residents, businesses and tourists in this part of Altrincham. It is also believed that the decluttering of George Street pavement and upgrade of old street furniture will be to the betterment of the local Conservation areas and help to enhance the character of the area.

Text: Conclusion Conclusion

Text: Conclusion It is widely recognised that street scenes up and down the country are constantly evolving, in which accommodating modern communication infrastructure is an essential part of this change. The proposed Street Hub is a slender, well-designed structure with advanced technology and public benefits that no other similar proposal can match. In
